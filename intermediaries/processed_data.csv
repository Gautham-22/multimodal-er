5,Ses01F_impro01_F005,Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.,3
6,Ses01F_impro01_F006,What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.,-1
7,Ses01F_impro01_F007,How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?,-1
8,Ses01F_impro01_F008,I'm here to get an ID.,-1
9,Ses01F_impro01_F009,Like what?  Like a birth certificate?,-1
10,Ses01F_impro01_F010,Who the hell has a birth certificate?,-1
11,Ses01F_impro01_F011,"Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?",-1
12,Ses01F_impro01_F012,That's out of control.,0

20,Ses01F_impro01_M004,This form is a Z.X.four.,-1
21,Ses01F_impro01_M005,"You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.",-1
22,Ses01F_impro01_M006,No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.,-1
23,Ses01F_impro01_M007,I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.,-1

28,Ses01F_impro01_M012,Actually too long.,-1
29,Ses01F_impro01_M013,Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,0

37,Ses01F_impro02_F007,"I'm not okay with it, but I don't-- it's not like I have a choice.  I don't see what crying about it is going to fix.",-1

51,Ses01F_impro02_M000,It's not fair.,-1

53,Ses01F_impro02_M002,"I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice.",-1
54,Ses01F_impro02_M003,I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.,-1
55,Ses01F_impro02_M004,Then why is that fair?  Why--,-1
56,Ses01F_impro02_M005,I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.,2

121,Ses01F_impro04_F001,I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.,3
122,Ses01F_impro04_F002,"I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.",-1
123,Ses01F_impro04_F003,What kind of a job?,-1
124,Ses01F_impro04_F004,Really?,-1
125,Ses01F_impro04_F005,He just...,3

137,Ses01F_impro04_F017,Why?  It's a piece of paper.,-1
138,Ses01F_impro04_F018,"I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.",-1
139,Ses01F_impro04_F019,"It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...",-1
140,Ses01F_impro04_F020,..I just-..I just think it's kind of prejudiced and they are really discriminating against people who just aren't that way.,-1
141,Ses01F_impro04_F021,"That's baloney, that's baloney.",-1
142,Ses01F_impro04_F022,Please.,-1
143,Ses01F_impro04_F023,you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?,-1
144,Ses01F_impro04_F024,"You know, you're riding the bus, too.",-1
145,Ses01F_impro04_F025,Why?  What choice?,-1

155,Ses01F_impro04_M001,Yeah.,3

164,Ses01F_impro04_M010,Hmm.,3
165,Ses01F_impro04_M011,I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,3
166,Ses01F_impro04_M012,Yeah.  Do you have a resume?,3
167,Ses01F_impro04_M013,It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,3
168,Ses01F_impro04_M014,Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,3
169,Ses01F_impro04_M015,"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",3
170,Ses01F_impro04_M016,"Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.",3
171,Ses01F_impro04_M017,"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",3
172,Ses01F_impro04_M018,"I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--",3
173,Ses01F_impro04_M019,Yeah.,3
174,Ses01F_impro04_M020,"Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.",3
175,Ses01F_impro04_M021,"Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",3
176,Ses01F_impro04_M022,maybe get a car.,3
177,Ses01F_impro04_M023,"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",3
178,Ses01F_impro04_M024,I didn't say that.,3
179,Ses01F_impro04_M025,"I am riding the bus, but by choice.",3
180,Ses01F_impro04_M026,"To save the environment, carpool.",3
181,Ses01F_impro04_M027,Yes.  One less car at a time.,3
182,Ses01F_impro04_M028,Mmhmm.,3
183,Ses01F_impro04_M029,"You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...",-1
184,Ses01F_impro04_M030,...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.,-1
185,Ses01F_impro04_M031,I don't think I'm anyone.,3
186,Ses01F_impro04_M032,I- I-I didn't-- okay.,3
187,Ses01F_impro04_M033,What?  No.,-1
188,Ses01F_impro04_M034,What? Oh.  So now you're...,-1
189,Ses01F_impro04_M035,you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.,-1

195,Ses01F_impro05_F004,I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.,-1

202,Ses01F_impro05_F011,Is this a joke?,0
203,Ses01F_impro05_F012,"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",0
204,Ses01F_impro05_F013,So you'll give me money and then I'll get my bag?,-1
205,Ses01F_impro05_F014,"You're kidding me, this is a joke.",0
206,Ses01F_impro05_F015,Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.,0
207,Ses01F_impro05_F016,We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,0
208,Ses01F_impro05_F017,I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,0
209,Ses01F_impro05_F018,Do you understand who my husband is?,0
210,Ses01F_impro05_F019,"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",0

219,Ses01F_impro05_F028,Okay.  I'll do that.,0
220,Ses01F_impro05_F029,I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,0
221,Ses01F_impro05_F030,A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.,0
222,Ses01F_impro05_M000,Hi.  Thanks for waiting.,3

232,Ses01F_impro05_M010,"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",3
233,Ses01F_impro05_M011,"we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...",3
234,Ses01F_impro05_M012,"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",3
235,Ses01F_impro05_M013,Yeah.,3
236,Ses01F_impro05_M014,"No, no.",3
237,Ses01F_impro05_M015,"No, no.  This is real.",3
238,Ses01F_impro05_M016,"No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",3
239,Ses01F_impro05_M017,this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.,3
240,Ses01F_impro05_M018,"Once again, I'm really- I'm really sorry.",-1
241,Ses01F_impro05_M019,Yes.,3
242,Ses01F_impro05_M020,I know.,3
243,Ses01F_impro05_M021,"I'm very sorry.  But if you see the sign that's right behind me here, it spells it out really clearly that we are not held liable--",-1
244,Ses01F_impro05_M022,Okay. Calm-,3
245,Ses01F_impro05_M023,"Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really",3
246,Ses01F_impro05_M024,"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",3
247,Ses01F_impro05_M025,It's a gift.,3
248,Ses01F_impro05_M026,"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",3
249,Ses01F_impro05_M027,With the amount of--,3
250,Ses01F_impro05_M028,"Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?",3
251,Ses01F_impro05_M029,Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,3
252,Ses01F_impro05_M030,"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",3
253,Ses01F_impro05_M031,Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.,3
254,Ses01F_impro05_M032,"Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess.",-1
255,Ses01F_impro05_M033,Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could.,-1
256,Ses01F_impro05_M034,"If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--",3
257,Ses01F_impro05_M035,"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",3
258,Ses01F_impro06_F000,It's okay.,-1
259,Ses01F_impro06_F001,"No, no, no.",-1
260,Ses01F_impro06_F002,No.,2
261,Ses01F_impro06_F003,That's sweet.,3
262,Ses01F_impro06_F004,Thank you.,3
263,Ses01F_impro06_F005,I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,2
264,Ses01F_impro06_F006,"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",2
265,Ses01F_impro06_F007,So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,2
266,Ses01F_impro06_F008,So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,2
267,Ses01F_impro06_F009,"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",3
268,Ses01F_impro06_F010,"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",2
269,Ses01F_impro06_F011,"And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.",2
270,Ses01F_impro06_F012,"I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.",2
271,Ses01F_impro06_F013,I don't know.,2
272,Ses01F_impro06_F014,At the cemetery?,2
273,Ses01F_impro06_F015,couple hours.,2
274,Ses01F_impro06_F016,"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.",3
275,Ses01F_impro06_F017,It was hot.[LIPSMACK],-1
276,Ses01F_impro06_F018,Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.,3
277,Ses01F_impro06_F019,Yeah.,3
278,Ses01F_impro06_F020,"It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",2
279,Ses01F_impro06_F021,"My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",2
280,Ses01F_impro06_F022,She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,2
281,Ses01F_impro06_F023,Umm. Yeah.,2
282,Ses01F_impro06_F024,"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",2
283,Ses01F_impro06_F025,"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",2
284,Ses01F_impro06_F026,"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",2
285,Ses01F_impro06_F027,"There's another one, I can't remember.",3
286,Ses01F_impro06_F028,"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?",2
287,Ses01F_impro06_M000,"I'm sorry, Joy.",2
288,Ses01F_impro06_M001,Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?,3

300,Ses01F_impro06_M013,"Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?",3
301,Ses01F_impro06_M014,Mmhmm.,3
302,Ses01F_impro06_M015,Mmhmm.,3

320,Ses01F_impro07_F015,Yeah.  Totally. [LAUGHTER],-1
321,Ses01F_impro07_F016,"I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.",1
322,Ses01F_impro07_M000,Did you get the letter?,1
323,Ses01F_impro07_M001,Yeah. That is so awesome.,1
324,Ses01F_impro07_M002,Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER],1
325,Ses01F_impro07_M003,"Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.",1

335,Ses01F_impro07_M013,"That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",3
336,Ses01F_impro07_M014,"Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.",1
337,Ses01F_impro07_M015,You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.,1
338,Ses01F_impro07_M016,"Mrs. Nash.  That's so awesome, though.",-1
339,Ses01F_impro07_M017,Yay...School's fun.,1

341,Ses01F_impro07_M019,That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.,1
342,Ses01F_script01_1_F000,What's he going to say?,-1
343,Ses01F_script01_1_F001,Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,-1
344,Ses01F_script01_1_F002,How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,-1
345,Ses01F_script01_1_F003,When?,-1
346,Ses01F_script01_1_F004,What was he doing out here at four o clock in the morning?,-1
347,Ses01F_script01_1_F005,"He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",3
348,Ses01F_script01_1_F006,It's getting to be just like after he died.  What's the meaning of that?,-1
349,Ses01F_script01_1_F007,What?,-1
350,Ses01F_script01_1_F008,What do you mean dishonest?,-1
351,Ses01F_script01_1_F009,What do you want to do?  Argue with him?,-1
352,Ses01F_script01_1_F010,You can't say that to him.,-1
353,Ses01F_script01_1_F011,Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?,-1
354,Ses01F_script01_1_F012,"To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?",-1
355,Ses01F_script01_1_F013,"It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--",-1
356,Ses01F_script01_1_F014,Why?,-1
357,Ses01F_script01_1_F015,"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",3
358,Ses01F_script01_1_F016,"Well that's only your business, Chris.",-1
359,Ses01F_script01_1_F017,Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,-1
360,Ses01F_script01_1_F018,Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --,-1
361,Ses01F_script01_1_F019,I'm just saying.,-1
362,Ses01F_script01_1_F020,Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.,-1
363,Ses01F_script01_1_F021,"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",-1
364,Ses01F_script01_1_F022,"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",-1
365,Ses01F_script01_1_F023,"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",-1
366,Ses01F_script01_1_F024,I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,-1
367,Ses01F_script01_1_F025,Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,-1
368,Ses01F_script01_1_F026,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,-1
369,Ses01F_script01_1_F027,Why does it have to be Annie?,-1
370,Ses01F_script01_1_F028,Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,-1
371,Ses01F_script01_1_F029,"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",-1
372,Ses01F_script01_1_F030,I don't want a diagram.,-1
373,Ses01F_script01_1_F031,He thinks he's coming back Chris.,-1
374,Ses01F_script01_1_F032,"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",-1
375,Ses01F_script01_1_F033,...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,-1
376,Ses01F_script01_1_F034,Just give it some more thought.,3
377,Ses01F_script01_1_F035,What the hell is this?,0
378,Ses01F_script01_1_F036,Are you crazy?,-1
379,Ses01F_script01_1_F037,You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,0
380,Ses01F_script01_1_F038,Oh.  Must you be inspired?,0
381,Ses01F_script01_1_F039,You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,-1
382,Ses01F_script01_1_F040,Well you don't want to think like that.,-1
383,Ses01F_script01_1_F041,"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",0
384,Ses01F_script01_1_F042,Just don't think like that.,0
385,Ses01F_script01_1_F043,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
386,Ses01F_script01_1_F044,I can see that.,-1
387,Ses01F_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,3
388,Ses01F_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,3
389,Ses01F_script01_1_M002,Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.,3
390,Ses01F_script01_1_M003,I don't know.,3
391,Ses01F_script01_1_M004,I guess he is.,3
392,Ses01F_script01_1_M005,"I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.",-1
393,Ses01F_script01_1_M006,"Being dishonest with him, you know.  This kind of thing always pays off and it's paying off.",-1
394,Ses01F_script01_1_M007,You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,3
395,Ses01F_script01_1_M008,I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.,-1
396,Ses01F_script01_1_M009,"You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?",-1
397,Ses01F_script01_1_M010,We've got to say it to him.,3
398,Ses01F_script01_1_M011,"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.",-1
399,Ses01F_script01_1_M012,"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",3
400,Ses01F_script01_1_M013,"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",-1
401,Ses01F_script01_1_M014,You know.,3
402,Ses01F_script01_1_M015,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,3
403,Ses01F_script01_1_M016,You know it's not just my business.,3
404,Ses01F_script01_1_M017,"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",3
405,Ses01F_script01_1_M018,Then it's not just my business.,-1
406,Ses01F_script01_1_M019,"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",0
407,Ses01F_script01_1_M020,She's not Larry's girl.,-1
408,Ses01F_script01_1_M021,"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",-1
409,Ses01F_script01_1_M022,To hell with that.,-1
410,Ses01F_script01_1_M023,I wanted to get this settled first.,3
411,Ses01F_script01_1_M024,"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",3
412,Ses01F_script01_1_M025,And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,3
413,Ses01F_script01_1_M026,So what.  I'm not fast with women.,-1
414,Ses01F_script01_1_M027,Because it is.,-1
415,Ses01F_script01_1_M028,I don't know.,-1
416,Ses01F_script01_1_M029,"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",-1
417,Ses01F_script01_1_M030,"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",-1
418,Ses01F_script01_1_M031,"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",-1
419,Ses01F_script01_1_M032,"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",-1
420,Ses01F_script01_1_M033,"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",-1
421,Ses01F_script01_1_M034,"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",3
422,Ses01F_script01_1_M035,"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.",-1
423,Ses01F_script01_1_M036,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,-1
424,Ses01F_script01_1_M037,"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",-1
425,Ses01F_script01_1_M038,"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",-1
426,Ses01F_script01_1_M039,"On this, I would.",3
427,Ses01F_script01_1_M040,Then help me stay here.,3
428,Ses01F_script01_1_M041,I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,-1
429,Ses01F_script01_1_M042,Well I am thinking like that.,-1
430,Ses01F_script01_1_M043,No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,-1
431,Ses01F_script01_2_F000,Why did he invite her here?,-1
432,Ses01F_script01_2_F001,"She's been in New York three and an half years, why all of a sudden?",-1
433,Ses01F_script01_2_F002,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,-1
434,Ses01F_script01_2_F003,He's not going to marry her.,0
435,Ses01F_script01_2_F004,It's got that about it.,0
436,Ses01F_script01_2_F005,"What is going on here, Joe?",0
437,Ses01F_script01_2_F006,She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,0
438,Ses01F_script01_2_F007,"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",0
439,Ses01F_script01_2_F008,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",0
440,Ses01F_script01_2_F009,"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",0
441,Ses01F_script01_2_F010,"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",0
442,Ses01F_script01_2_F011,I won't stand for any nonsense.,0
443,Ses01F_script01_2_F012,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",0
444,Ses01F_script01_2_F013,"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",0
445,Ses01F_script01_2_F014,I can't help it.,-1
446,Ses01F_script01_2_M000,Why does that bother you?,-1
447,Ses01F_script01_2_M001,Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,3
448,Ses01F_script01_2_M002,"What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?",-1
449,Ses01F_script01_2_M003,[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,-1
450,Ses01F_script01_2_M004,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,3
451,Ses01F_script01_2_M005,Oh.  So what.,-1
452,Ses01F_script01_2_M006,Now listen.,-1
453,Ses01F_script01_2_M007,You can't read her mind.,-1
454,Ses01F_script01_2_M008,How do you know why she waited?,3
455,Ses01F_script01_2_M009,"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",-1
456,Ses01F_script01_2_M010,What do you want me to do? What do you want?,-1
457,Ses01F_script01_2_M011,Kate.,-1
458,Ses01F_script01_2_M012,[BREATHING],-1
459,Ses01F_script01_2_M013,Calm yourself.,-1
460,Ses01F_script01_2_M014,Okay. Calm yourself.,-1
461,Ses01F_script01_2_M015,"I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?",-1
462,Ses01F_script01_2_M016,"Look at you, you're shaking.",-1
463,Ses01F_script01_2_M017,"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",0
464,Ses01F_script01_3_F000,You're the only one who still loves his parents.,3
465,Ses01F_script01_3_F001,It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,3
466,Ses01F_script01_3_F002,"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",3
467,Ses01F_script01_3_F003,"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",3
468,Ses01F_script01_3_F004,"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",3
469,Ses01F_script01_3_F005,"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",3
470,Ses01F_script01_3_F006,Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,3
471,Ses01F_script01_3_F007,I knew they would.,3
472,Ses01F_script01_3_F008,"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",3
473,Ses01F_script01_3_F009,"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",3
474,Ses01F_script01_3_F010,[BREATHING],1
475,Ses01F_script01_3_F011,[LAUGHTER],1
476,Ses01F_script01_3_F012,[LAUGHTER],1
477,Ses01F_script01_3_F013,No. No,1
478,Ses01F_script01_3_F014,"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",3
479,Ses01F_script01_3_F015,I almost got married two years ago.,3
480,Ses01F_script01_3_F016,You started to write me.,3
481,Ses01F_script01_3_F017,Every day since.,1
482,Ses01F_script01_3_F018,"I was waiting for you, Chris.  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.  And when you did finally write me,",-1
483,Ses01F_script01_3_F019,beating around the bush.,1
484,Ses01F_script01_3_F020,"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",1
485,Ses01F_script01_3_F021,Not like that you're not.,1
486,Ses01F_script01_3_F022,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",3
487,Ses01F_script01_3_F023,"Chris, what is it?",-1
488,Ses01F_script01_3_F024,No. What is it?  Is it your mother?,-1
489,Ses01F_script01_3_F025,"Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",-1
490,Ses01F_script01_3_F026,You've got to tell me.,-1
491,Ses01F_script01_3_F027,It wouldn't work like this.,-1
492,Ses01F_script01_3_F028,"Yeah, sure.",3
493,Ses01F_script01_3_F029,How many?,3
494,Ses01F_script01_3_F030,"Aw, geez.",2
495,Ses01F_script01_3_F031,Mmhmm.,3
496,Ses01F_script01_3_F032,Do you still feel that way?,-1
497,Ses01F_script01_3_F033,"Because you mustn't feel that way.  Everything you have, you've earned - everything.  you understand me?",-1
498,Ses01F_script01_3_F034,"Even me.  And your money?  Chris, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",-1
499,Ses01F_script01_3_F035,What would I do with a fortune?,1
500,Ses01F_script01_3_M000,"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",3
501,Ses01F_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came.,3
502,Ses01F_script01_3_M002,Why not?,-1
503,Ses01F_script01_3_M003,Well.,3
504,Ses01F_script01_3_M004,What?,3
505,Ses01F_script01_3_M005,Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,3
506,Ses01F_script01_3_M006,You did?,-1
507,Ses01F_script01_3_M007,"So would you want to?  I mean, I guess you have to know that's kind of why I asked you to come?",-1
508,Ses01F_script01_3_M008,"I love you. Annie, I love you.",1
509,Ses01F_script01_3_M009,"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",1
510,Ses01F_script01_3_M010,"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",1
511,Ses01F_script01_3_M011,"You feel uncomfortable here, you feel that it's wrong here somehow.  I just...I don't...I didn't want...I didn't want to take you away from anything.",-1
512,Ses01F_script01_3_M012,And he's gone forever?  Are you sure?,-1
513,Ses01F_script01_3_M013,Why didn't you?,-1
514,Ses01F_script01_3_M014,You felt something that far back?,-1
515,Ses01F_script01_3_M015,Why didn't you let me know?,1
516,Ses01F_script01_3_M016,Give me a...,1
517,Ses01F_script01_3_M017,Give me a kiss.,1
518,Ses01F_script01_3_M018,God.  I kissed you Annie.,-1
519,Ses01F_script01_3_M019,"Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.",1
520,Ses01F_script01_3_M020,I kissed you.,1
521,Ses01F_script01_3_M021,"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",2
522,Ses01F_script01_3_M022,No it's nothing like that. It's-,2
523,Ses01F_script01_3_M023,Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,2
524,Ses01F_script01_3_M024,I don't even know how to start.,2
525,Ses01F_script01_3_M025,"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",2
526,Ses01F_script01_3_M026,Well I lost them.,2
527,Ses01F_script01_3_M027,Pretty much all.,2
528,Ses01F_script01_3_M028,You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,2
529,Ses01F_script01_3_M029,"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",2
530,Ses01F_script01_3_M030,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",2
531,Ses01F_script01_3_M031,"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.",-1
532,Ses01F_script01_3_M032,"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",2
533,Ses01F_script01_3_M033,"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",2
534,Ses01F_script01_3_M034,Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.,-1
535,Ses01F_script01_3_M035,"I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.",-1
536,Ses01F_script01_3_M036,And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,2
537,Ses01F_script01_3_M037,I just want you to know Annie.,3
538,Ses01F_script01_3_M038,"Annie, Annie.  I am going to make a fortune for you.",-1
539,Ses01F_script02_1_F000,Fine.,3
540,Ses01F_script02_1_F001,[BREATHING],-1
541,Ses01F_script02_1_F002,What?,-1
542,Ses01F_script02_1_F003,What flashlight?,-1
543,Ses01F_script02_1_F004,That's not your flashlight.,3
544,Ses01F_script02_1_F005,It's ours; it's my flashlight too.,-1
545,Ses01F_script02_1_F006,You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,0
546,Ses01F_script02_1_F007,How's that supposed to make me feel?,0
547,Ses01F_script02_1_F008,Yeah.,3
548,Ses01F_script02_1_F009,[LAUGHTER],1
549,Ses01F_script02_1_F010,I'm cold.,2
550,Ses01F_script02_1_F011,"It's after eleven, let's go.",-1
551,Ses01F_script02_1_F012,There is no point.,-1
552,Ses01F_script02_1_F013,That's my point.,-1
553,Ses01F_script02_1_F014,"Well, then let's go.",-1
554,Ses01F_script02_1_F015,Not particularly.,3
555,Ses01F_script02_1_F016,I just don't.  It's stupid.,-1
556,Ses01F_script02_1_F017,"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",-1
557,Ses01F_script02_1_F018,I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,-1
558,Ses01F_script02_1_F019,Oh Augie,-1
559,Ses01F_script02_1_F020,I'm just not.,-1
560,Ses01F_script02_1_F021,Yeah.,-1
561,Ses01F_script02_1_F022,"Last time, you'll also remember, we got our shoes wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat and we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",-1
562,Ses01F_script02_1_F023,Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,-1
563,Ses01F_script02_1_F024,That's the wind.,3
564,Ses01F_script02_1_F025,About what?,3
565,Ses01F_script02_1_M000,"What time is it?  I think it's supposed to run around midnight, right?  God, this is great, isn't it, Carla?  Look at this night we got here, huh.",-1
566,Ses01F_script02_1_M001,"Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?",-1
567,Ses01F_script02_1_M002,"Okay.  Is that, is that--",1
568,Ses01F_script02_1_M003,No.  That's just foam.  I don't know.  I can't tell.,-1
569,Ses01F_script02_1_M004,"I don't know, probably if you can't tell, though, it's probably not them, right?  It's probably going to be like this unmistakable thing, right?",-1
570,Ses01F_script02_1_M005,Oh no.  you know what I forgot?,-1
571,Ses01F_script02_1_M006,"My flashlight.  God, how could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",-1
572,Ses01F_script02_1_M007,"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",3
573,Ses01F_script02_1_M008,Whose is it?,3
574,Ses01F_script02_1_M009,"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",3
575,Ses01F_script02_1_M010,No.,3
576,Ses01F_script02_1_M011,"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",3
577,Ses01F_script02_1_M012,"Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though.",-1
578,Ses01F_script02_1_M013,Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,3
579,Ses01F_script02_1_M014,"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",3
580,Ses01F_script02_1_M015,"Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?",3
581,Ses01F_script02_1_M016,"God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.",1
582,Ses01F_script02_1_M017,I wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,-1
583,Ses01F_script02_1_M018,Do you want my jacket?,-1
584,Ses01F_script02_1_M019,What?  We just got here.  What's the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home?,-1
585,Ses01F_script02_1_M020,Right.,3
586,Ses01F_script02_1_M021,"Wait, that's my point, too.",3
587,Ses01F_script02_1_M022,"No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",-1
588,Ses01F_script02_1_M023,Why not?,3
589,Ses01F_script02_1_M024,"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",3
590,Ses01F_script02_1_M025,Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,3
591,Ses01F_script02_1_M026,This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,3
592,Ses01F_script02_1_M027,Yeah they do.,-1
593,Ses01F_script02_1_M028,"okay... well, Whatever.  But it's a fish who do something no other fish do.  It's like those swallows returning to Capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs.",-1
594,Ses01F_script02_1_M029,"There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.",3
595,Ses01F_script02_1_M030,For real?,-1
596,Ses01F_script02_1_M031,"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",3
597,Ses01F_script02_1_M032,"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",3
598,Ses01F_script02_1_M033,Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,3
599,Ses01F_script02_1_M034,"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",3
600,Ses01F_script02_1_M035,"Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.",1
601,Ses01F_script02_1_M036,"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",1
602,Ses01F_script02_1_M037,"Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.",-1
603,Ses01F_script02_1_M038,"Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.",1
604,Ses01F_script02_1_M039,They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.,-1
605,Ses01F_script02_1_M040,It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.,1
606,Ses01F_script02_1_M041,And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.,-1
607,Ses01F_script02_1_M042,"Oh look.  I'm giving myself goose bumps, my hairs are standing up on my arm.",-1
608,Ses01F_script02_1_M043,So what do you think?,1
609,Ses01F_script02_1_M044,"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",1
610,Ses01F_script02_2_F000,That's the wind.,3
611,Ses01F_script02_2_F001,About what?,3
612,Ses01F_script02_2_F002,I think it's ridiculous.,-1
613,Ses01F_script02_2_F003,It's PR! Somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach.,-1
614,Ses01F_script02_2_F004,"Everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us coming back for more, it keeps us excited.  We keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot, get in on the action.",-1
615,Ses01F_script02_2_F005,"I'm sorry, it's just fish to me.",-1
616,Ses01F_script02_2_F006,"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",0
617,Ses01F_script02_2_F007,We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.,-1
618,Ses01F_script02_2_F008,"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",0
619,Ses01F_script02_2_F009,Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,0
620,Ses01F_script02_2_F010,Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,0
621,Ses01F_script02_2_F011,No they won't.  It's like waiting for Santa Claus.,-1
622,Ses01F_script02_2_F012,I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.,-1
623,Ses01F_script02_2_F013,You don't understand anything I am saying.,-1
624,Ses01F_script02_2_F014,"I did want to see it, I still do, I always do.  I just...",-1
625,Ses01F_script02_2_F015,"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",2
626,Ses01F_script02_2_F016,"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",0
627,Ses01F_script02_2_F017,Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.,3
628,Ses01F_script02_2_F018,"We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.",-1
629,Ses01F_script02_2_F019,"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1
630,Ses01F_script02_2_F020,"Drinking champagne from the bottle,",-1
631,Ses01F_script02_2_F021,dancing barefoot in the sand.,-1
632,Ses01F_script02_2_F022,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,2
633,Ses01F_script02_2_F023,No.,3
634,Ses01F_script02_2_F024,No.,-1
635,Ses01F_script02_2_F025,"No, no. Nothing.",-1
636,Ses01F_script02_2_F026,No.,3
637,Ses01F_script02_2_F027,No.,-1
638,Ses01F_script02_2_F028,I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.,-1
639,Ses01F_script02_2_F029,[BREATHING],-1
640,Ses01F_script02_2_F030,This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.,-1
641,Ses01F_script02_2_F031,Sure.  This is standing on the beach waiting.  This is fighting.,-1
642,Ses01F_script02_2_F032,"I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...",-1
643,Ses01F_script02_2_F033,Do you understand what I am saying?,-1
644,Ses01F_script02_2_F034,"I know you are Augie, I know.",2
645,Ses01F_script02_2_F035,"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",2
646,Ses01F_script02_2_F036,I didn't say that.,2
647,Ses01F_script02_2_F037,"Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",-1
648,Ses01F_script02_2_F038,Yeah.  Don't you know that?,-1
649,Ses01F_script02_2_F039,For Heaven's sake Augie.,-1
650,Ses01F_script02_2_F040,"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",2
651,Ses01F_script02_2_F041,"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",3
652,Ses01F_script02_2_F042,"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",1
653,Ses01F_script02_2_F043,"Augie, you bought refreshments.",1
654,Ses01F_script02_2_F044,I guess we don't need glasses.,1
655,Ses01F_script02_2_F045,I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,1
656,Ses01F_script02_2_F046,"Augie, I'm sorry.",2
657,Ses01F_script02_2_F047,Or not.,3
658,Ses01F_script02_2_M000,"Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.",1
659,Ses01F_script02_2_M001,"Well, so, what do you think?",1
660,Ses01F_script02_2_M002,About what I was saying.,3
661,Ses01F_script02_2_M003,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,-1
662,Ses01F_script02_2_M004,"Not just me, look at all of these people.",-1
663,Ses01F_script02_2_M005,"Are we talking about the same thing, here?",-1
664,Ses01F_script02_2_M006,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",3
665,Ses01F_script02_2_M007,"Well then, what's bugging you?",-1
666,Ses01F_script02_2_M008,"There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.",-1
667,Ses01F_script02_2_M009,Why not?,-1
668,Ses01F_script02_2_M010,We've missed them twice.,-1
669,Ses01F_script02_2_M011,They'll show up this time.,-1
670,Ses01F_script02_2_M012,I thought you wanted to see it.,-1
671,Ses01F_script02_2_M013,No. Of course not.,-1
672,Ses01F_script02_2_M014,"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.",-1
673,Ses01F_script02_2_M015,Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,-1
674,Ses01F_script02_2_M016,"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",3
675,Ses01F_script02_2_M017,"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",3
676,Ses01F_script02_2_M018,"Wait a minute, I got it.",-1
677,Ses01F_script02_2_M019,"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",3
678,Ses01F_script02_2_M020,"That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?",-1
679,Ses01F_script02_2_M021,Sure.  All right.  Okay.,3
680,Ses01F_script02_2_M022,"Listen, do you want to dance?",3
681,Ses01F_script02_2_M023,Do you want me to go get some champagne?,3
682,Ses01F_script02_2_M024,Do you want to take off your shoes?,1
683,Ses01F_script02_2_M025,Then what?,-1
684,Ses01F_script02_2_M026,Do you want to get married again?,1
685,Ses01F_script02_2_M027,What?  What?  Do you want a divorce?,-1
686,Ses01F_script02_2_M028,A vacation?,-1
687,Ses01F_script02_2_M029,Like a new carpet?  A poodle?  A back rub?  Ice cream?  A suicide pact?  What do you want?  What the hell do you want?,-1
688,Ses01F_script02_2_M030,"Well welcome to the human race, huh?  Do you think I had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish?  No.",-1
689,Ses01F_script02_2_M031,"No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?",-1
690,Ses01F_script02_2_M032,Do you know what you get?  You get this.,-1
691,Ses01F_script02_2_M033,Yes it is.,3
692,Ses01F_script02_2_M034,Right,-1
693,Ses01F_script02_2_M035,[BREATHING],-1
694,Ses01F_script02_2_M036,I'm doing the best I can.,-1
695,Ses01F_script02_2_M037,"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",2
696,Ses01F_script02_2_M038,I just- I know I don't make you happy.,2
697,Ses01F_script02_2_M039,Yeah?,-1
698,Ses01F_script02_2_M040,"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",3
699,Ses01F_script02_2_M041,"I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.",-1
700,Ses01F_script02_2_M042,"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",3
701,Ses01F_script02_2_M043,[BREATHING],3
702,Ses01F_script02_2_M044,And look what I got here.,1
703,Ses01F_script02_2_M045,It's not champagne.,-1
704,Ses01F_script02_2_M046,[BREATHING],1
705,Ses01F_script02_2_M047,Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,3
706,Ses01F_script02_2_M048,"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",3
707,Ses01F_script02_2_M049,Or not.,1
708,Ses01F_script03_1_F000,Is it them?,-1
709,Ses01F_script03_1_F001,Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up.,-1
710,Ses01F_script03_1_F002,It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do?,-1
711,Ses01F_script03_1_F003,"Now and always, sweet.",-1
712,Ses01F_script03_1_F004,It had to happen sooner or later.,-1
713,Ses01F_script03_1_F005,[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.,1
714,Ses01F_script03_1_F006,We'll behave exquisitely.,1
715,Ses01F_script03_1_F007,I think I shall do a curtsy.,1
716,Ses01F_script03_1_F008,Hmm.  The pity is that one can't stay happy.,-1
717,Ses01F_script03_1_F009,It's true.  I think the whole thing's a cruel joke.,-1
718,Ses01F_script03_1_F010,Yes.  Meaning just that.,1
719,Ses01F_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,1
720,Ses01F_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,1
721,Ses01F_script03_1_F013,"you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.",-1
722,Ses01F_script03_1_F014,"How long with it last, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours?",-1
723,Ses01F_script03_1_F015,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,-1
724,Ses01F_script03_1_F016,"Oh dear, should we like that?",-1
725,Ses01F_script03_1_F017,What happens if one of us dies?  Does the other one still laugh?,-1
726,Ses01F_script03_1_F018,"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",-1
727,Ses01F_script03_1_F019,I think you are talking nonsense.,-1
728,Ses01F_script03_1_F020,[LAUGHTER],1
729,Ses01F_script03_1_F021,"Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.",1
730,Ses01F_script03_1_F022,"Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.",1
731,Ses01F_script03_1_F023,Which particular one?,-1
732,Ses01F_script03_1_F024,"Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.",1
733,Ses01F_script03_1_F025,I know you did.  You threw him out the window into the Grand Canal.  I'll never forgive you for that.,-1
734,Ses01F_script03_1_F026,It went on intermittently for days.,-1
735,Ses01F_script03_1_F027,"Oh And it burnt my comb, too, and all of those towels in the bathroom.",-1
736,Ses01F_script03_1_F028,[LAUGHTER] That was the first time you hit me.,-1
737,Ses01F_script03_1_F029,"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",1
738,Ses01F_script03_1_F030,[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,1
739,Ses01F_script03_1_F031,Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,-1
740,Ses01F_script03_1_M000,Good God.,-1
741,Ses01F_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,-1
742,Ses01F_script03_1_M002,It must be them then.,-1
743,Ses01F_script03_1_M003,[BREATHING],-1
744,Ses01F_script03_1_M004,"We are okay, aren't we darling?",-1
745,Ses01F_script03_1_M005,I don't care then.,1
746,Ses01F_script03_1_M006,"Hello?  Hello?  I'm sorry, what's that?",-1
747,Ses01F_script03_1_M007,No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],1
748,Ses01F_script03_1_M008,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],1
749,Ses01F_script03_1_M009,With perfect poise.,1
750,Ses01F_script03_1_M010,"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?",1
751,Ses01F_script03_1_M011,"Darling, don't say that.",-1
752,Ses01F_script03_1_M012,What?  This beautiful and sacred thing - love?,-1
753,Ses01F_script03_1_M013,"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",1
754,Ses01F_script03_1_M014,"Oh darling, you mustn't be serious.  It's just what they want.",-1
755,Ses01F_script03_1_M015,"All of those futile moralists who make life unbearable.  You have to laugh at them, be flippant.",-1
756,Ses01F_script03_1_M016,"You know, flippancy brings out the acid in their darned, light and sweetness.",-1
757,Ses01F_script03_1_M017,Oh of course.  We are figures of fun.  All right.,-1
758,Ses01F_script03_1_M018,Who knows?,1
759,Ses01F_script03_1_M019,Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,-1
760,Ses01F_script03_1_M020,Well it depends on how well we've played.,-1
761,Ses01F_script03_1_M021,Yes.  Yes with all of his might.,1
762,Ses01F_script03_1_M022,"No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.",-1
763,Ses01F_script03_1_M023,"Oh.  So is everyone, in the long run.",-1
764,Ses01F_script03_1_M024,"Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.",1
765,Ses01F_script03_1_M025,Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,1
766,Ses01F_script03_1_M026,"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",1
767,Ses01F_script03_1_M027,Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,-1
768,Ses01F_script03_1_M028,The one where you put that tiny painted wooden snake in my bed.,-1
769,Ses01F_script03_1_M029,[GARBAGE],-1
770,Ses01F_script03_1_M030,It was a terrible thing.  I hated it.,-1
771,Ses01F_script03_1_M031,How long did that row last?,-1
772,Ses01F_script03_1_M032,Uh huh.,-1
773,Ses01F_script03_1_M033,But the worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,-1
774,Ses01F_script03_1_M034,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",1
775,Ses01F_script03_1_M035,I did not hit you very hard.,-1
776,Ses01F_script03_1_M036,[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],1
777,Ses01F_script03_1_M037,[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.,1
778,Ses01F_script03_1_M038,However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,-1
779,Ses01F_script03_2_F000,And very much sillier.,1
780,Ses01F_script03_2_F001,Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,1
781,Ses01F_script03_2_F002,"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",1
782,Ses01F_script03_2_F003,"It was not.  I still have it, and I wear it often.  It is very pretty.",-1
783,Ses01F_script03_2_F004,I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,3
784,Ses01F_script03_2_F005,"Well, what of it?",3
785,Ses01F_script03_2_F006,It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,-1
786,Ses01F_script03_2_F007,"If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",-1
787,Ses01F_script03_2_F008,Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.,-1
788,Ses01F_script03_2_F009,No.  Thank you.,-1
789,Ses01F_script03_2_F010,"I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.",-1
790,Ses01F_script03_2_F011,I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.,-1
791,Ses01F_script03_2_F012,It's become a habit with you.,-1
792,Ses01F_script03_2_F013,Don't be stupid.,0
793,Ses01F_script03_2_F014,What?,0
794,Ses01F_script03_2_F015,No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,0
795,Ses01F_script03_2_F016,Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,0
796,Ses01F_script03_2_F017,No it isn't.,0
797,Ses01F_script03_2_F018,You shut up.,0
798,Ses01F_script03_2_F019,It's funny it hasn't worked such wonders for you.,-1
799,Ses01F_script03_2_F020,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",-1
800,Ses01F_script03_2_F021,They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,0
801,Ses01F_script03_2_F022,"Yes I did, quite a lot.",0
802,Ses01F_script03_2_F023,Mind your own business.,0
803,Ses01F_script03_2_F024,"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",0
804,Ses01F_script03_2_F025,You've always had a weak head.,0
805,Ses01F_script03_2_F026,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",0
806,Ses01F_script03_2_F027,Oh shut up.,0
807,Ses01F_script03_2_F028,Shut up.,0
808,Ses01F_script03_2_F029,"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",0
809,Ses01F_script03_2_F030,Why?,3
810,Ses01F_script03_2_F031,There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,3
811,Ses01F_script03_2_F032,They are away in Tunis.,3
812,Ses01F_script03_2_F033,"Turn it on again, please.",-1
813,Ses01F_script03_2_F034,Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,0
814,Ses01F_script03_2_F035,"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",0
815,Ses01F_script03_2_F036,"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",0
816,Ses01F_script03_2_F037,"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",0
817,Ses01F_script03_2_F038,This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,0
818,Ses01F_script03_2_F039,Oh.  Yes I am.,0
819,Ses01F_script03_2_F040,"Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.",0
820,Ses01F_script03_2_M000,We were very much younger then.,-1
821,Ses01F_script03_2_M001,However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,3
822,Ses01F_script03_2_M002,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,3
823,Ses01F_script03_2_M003,"It was bristling with diamonds.  In the worst possible taste, too.",-1
824,Ses01F_script03_2_M004,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,3
825,Ses01F_script03_2_M005,"Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did.",-1
826,Ses01F_script03_2_M006,What of it?,-1
827,Ses01F_script03_2_M007,What about me?,0
828,Ses01F_script03_2_M008,"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",-1
829,Ses01F_script03_2_M009,So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?,-1
830,Ses01F_script03_2_M010,"I'll have a little, I think.",3
831,Ses01F_script03_2_M011,"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.",3
832,Ses01F_script03_2_M012,"You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.",-1
833,Ses01F_script03_2_M013,Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.,-1

1278,Ses01M_script01_1_F000,What he's going to say?,-1
1279,Ses01M_script01_1_F001,When?,-1
1280,Ses01M_script01_1_F002,How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed.,-1
1281,Ses01M_script01_1_F003,What was he doing here at four in the morning?,-1
1282,Ses01M_script01_1_F004,Did you talk to him?,2
1283,Ses01M_script01_1_F005,Cried hard?,2
1284,Ses01M_script01_1_F006,[BREATHING],2
1285,Ses01M_script01_1_F007,What is he doing out here at that hour?,-1
1286,Ses01M_script01_1_F008,"He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.",0
1287,Ses01M_script01_1_F009,It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?,-1
1288,Ses01M_script01_1_F010,What?,-1
1289,Ses01M_script01_1_F011,What do you mean a mistake?,0
1290,Ses01M_script01_1_F012,"What do you want to do, argue with him?",-1
1291,Ses01M_script01_1_F013,You can't say that to him.,-1
1292,Ses01M_script01_1_F014,"What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?",0
1293,Ses01M_script01_1_F015,"To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?",0
1294,Ses01M_script01_1_F016,The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--,0
1295,Ses01M_script01_1_F017,Why?,0
1296,Ses01M_script01_1_F018,"Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",-1
1297,Ses01M_script01_1_F019,"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",-1
1298,Ses01M_script01_1_F020,"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.",0
1299,Ses01M_script01_1_F021,You want to make sure that your father's not going to...,-1
1300,Ses01M_script01_1_F022,I'm just saying.,-1
1301,Ses01M_script01_1_F023,I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,0
1302,Ses01M_script01_1_F024,"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",0
1303,Ses01M_script01_1_F025,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,3
1304,Ses01M_script01_1_F026,Did you ask Annie yet?,3
1305,Ses01M_script01_1_F027,"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.",-1
1306,Ses01M_script01_1_F028,"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",-1
1307,Ses01M_script01_1_F029,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,0
1308,Ses01M_script01_1_F030,"That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",0
1309,Ses01M_script01_1_F031,"He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",2
1310,Ses01M_script01_1_F032,"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.",0
1311,Ses01M_script01_1_F033,Give it some more thought.,-1
1312,Ses01M_script01_1_F034,What the hell is this?,-1
1313,Ses01M_script01_1_F035,Are you crazy?,0
1314,Ses01M_script01_1_F036,You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?,0
1315,Ses01M_script01_1_F037,"Oh, must you be inspired.",0
1316,Ses01M_script01_1_F038,You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.,-1
1317,Ses01M_script01_1_F039,"Well, you don't want to think like that.",0
1318,Ses01M_script01_1_F040,"All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.",0
1319,Ses01M_script01_1_F041,"Well, you don't think like that.",0
1320,Ses01M_script01_1_F042,"I don't understand you, do I?",0
1321,Ses01M_script01_1_F043,"Well, I can see that.",0
1322,Ses01M_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,3
1323,Ses01M_script01_1_M001,He was out here at four this morning.,-1
1324,Ses01M_script01_1_M002,I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.,3
1325,Ses01M_script01_1_M003,I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.,2
1326,Ses01M_script01_1_M004,No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.,2
1327,Ses01M_script01_1_M005,"Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.",2
1328,Ses01M_script01_1_M006,I don't know.,2
1329,Ses01M_script01_1_M007,I guess he is.,2
1330,Ses01M_script01_1_M008,I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.,-1
1331,Ses01M_script01_1_M009,"I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.",-1
1332,Ses01M_script01_1_M010,"I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?",-1
1333,Ses01M_script01_1_M011,"I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.",-1
1334,Ses01M_script01_1_M012,I got to.,-1
1335,Ses01M_script01_1_M013,"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",-1
1336,Ses01M_script01_1_M014,"Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",-1
1337,Ses01M_script01_1_M015,"Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?",-1
1338,Ses01M_script01_1_M016,You know.,-1
1339,Ses01M_script01_1_M017,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,3
1340,Ses01M_script01_1_M018,You know it's not just my business.,-1
1341,Ses01M_script01_1_M019,So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?,-1
1342,Ses01M_script01_1_M020,"See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?",0
1343,Ses01M_script01_1_M021,She is not Larry's girl.,0
1344,Ses01M_script01_1_M022,I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...,-1
1345,Ses01M_script01_1_M023,To hell with that.,0
1346,Ses01M_script01_1_M024,"No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",2
1347,Ses01M_script01_1_M025,"Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",-1
1348,Ses01M_script01_1_M026,So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.,-1
1349,Ses01M_script01_1_M027,Because it is.,-1
1350,Ses01M_script01_1_M028,"I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.",-1
1351,Ses01M_script01_1_M029,All right then.,-1
1352,Ses01M_script01_1_M030,I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.,-1
1353,Ses01M_script01_1_M031,"When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.",-1
1354,Ses01M_script01_1_M032,I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.,-1
1355,Ses01M_script01_1_M033,I'll do it.,-1
1356,Ses01M_script01_1_M034,Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0
1357,Ses01M_script01_1_M035,"Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.",0
1358,Ses01M_script01_1_M036,If that can't happen here...,-1
1359,Ses01M_script01_1_M037,"Yes, on this I would.",3
1360,Ses01M_script01_1_M038,Then help me stay here mom.,2
1361,Ses01M_script01_1_M039,"I know, I know.",-1
1362,Ses01M_script01_1_M040,Then help me stay.,2
1363,Ses01M_script01_1_M041,I am thinking like that.,0
1364,Ses01M_script01_1_M042,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",2
1365,Ses01M_script01_2_F000,Why did he invite her here?,0
1366,Ses01M_script01_2_F001,It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,0
1367,Ses01M_script01_2_F002,He's not going to marry her.,-1
1368,Ses01M_script01_2_F003,it's got that about it.,-1
1369,Ses01M_script01_2_F004,"What is going on here, Joe?",0
1370,Ses01M_script01_2_F005,The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,0
1371,Ses01M_script01_2_F006,Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men probably a hundred people told her she is crazy but she is waited.,-1
1372,Ses01M_script01_2_F007,Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. in my darkest moments I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.,-1
1373,Ses01M_script01_2_F008,"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.",-1
1374,Ses01M_script01_2_F009,"I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",0
1375,Ses01M_script01_2_F010,Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.,-1
1376,Ses01M_script01_2_F011,"Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.",0
1377,Ses01M_script01_2_F012,"Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",0
1378,Ses01M_script01_2_F013,You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,0
1379,Ses01M_script01_2_F014,I can't help it.,-1
1380,Ses01M_script01_2_M000,"Well, maybe he wanted see her.",3
1381,Ses01M_script01_2_M001,"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",3
1382,Ses01M_script01_2_M002,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.,-1
1383,Ses01M_script01_2_M003,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,-1
1384,Ses01M_script01_2_M004,Oh so what?,-1
1385,Ses01M_script01_2_M005,"Okay, now listen, kids...",-1
1386,Ses01M_script01_2_M006,Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.,-1
1387,Ses01M_script01_2_M007,And how do you know why she's waited.,3
1388,Ses01M_script01_2_M008,"Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?",-1
1389,Ses01M_script01_2_M009,What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,-1
1390,Ses01M_script01_2_M010,Kate...,-1
1391,Ses01M_script01_2_M011,[BREATHING],-1
1392,Ses01M_script01_2_M012,"All right, calm yourself.",-1
1393,Ses01M_script01_2_M013,"Okay, calm yourself. Alright.",-1
1394,Ses01M_script01_2_M014,calm yourself.,-1
1395,Ses01M_script01_2_M015,What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?,0
1396,Ses01M_script01_2_M016,Look at you. You're shaking.,0
1397,Ses01M_script01_2_M017,"What the hell do you want from me, Kate?",0
1398,Ses01M_script01_3_F000,The only one I know still love his parents.,3
1399,Ses01M_script01_3_F001,Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.,3
1400,Ses01M_script01_3_F002,"You know it's nice here, the air is sweet.",-1
1401,Ses01M_script01_3_F003,"Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.",2
1402,Ses01M_script01_3_F004,For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,3
1403,Ses01M_script01_3_F005,[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,2
1404,Ses01M_script01_3_F006,You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,2
1405,Ses01M_script01_3_F007,"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",-1
1406,Ses01M_script01_3_F008,From her point of view why else would I come?,3
1407,Ses01M_script01_3_F009,Well I guess that's why I came.,-1
1408,Ses01M_script01_3_F010,"Chris,",-1
1409,Ses01M_script01_3_F011,"I've been ready a long, long time.",-1
1410,Ses01M_script01_3_F012,I almost got married two years ago.,3
1411,Ses01M_script01_3_F013,You started to write me.,-1
1412,Ses01M_script01_3_F014,Everyday since.,1
1413,Ses01M_script01_3_F015,"Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.",1
1414,Ses01M_script01_3_F016,I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.,1
1415,Ses01M_script01_3_F017,"Like Larry's brother.  Do what like you, Chris.",-1
1416,Ses01M_script01_3_F018,"Chris, what's the matter?",2
1417,Ses01M_script01_3_F019,"No, what is it?  Is your mother?",2
1418,Ses01M_script01_3_F020,"Well, then what?  You know, even in your letter you seem kind of ashamed.",-1
1419,Ses01M_script01_3_F021,You got to tell me.,2
1420,Ses01M_script01_3_F022,Wouldn't work like this.,2
1421,Ses01M_script01_3_F023,"Yeah, sure.",2

1426,Ses01M_script01_3_F028,Everything Chris do you understand that?  To me too...,-1
1427,Ses01M_script01_3_F029,And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes into the air.  You should be proud of that a man should be paid for that.,-1
1428,Ses01M_script01_3_F030,What would I do with a fortune?,1
1429,Ses01M_script01_3_M000,"Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?",1
1430,Ses01M_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came?,1
1431,Ses01M_script01_3_M002,Why not?,2
1432,Ses01M_script01_3_M003,Well.,-1
1433,Ses01M_script01_3_M004,What?,3
1434,Ses01M_script01_3_M005,"I was kind of planning on sneaking up on you, you know over like a course of a week or so. They just take for granted that we're already set.",-1
1435,Ses01M_script01_3_M006,You did?,3
1436,Ses01M_script01_3_M007,Yeah--,3
1437,Ses01M_script01_3_M008,"So then would you want to?  I mean I guess, you kind of have to know, maybe that's why I asked you to come.",-1
1438,Ses01M_script01_3_M009,"Ann, I love you.  I love you.",1
1439,Ses01M_script01_3_M010,I love you a great deal.,-1
1440,Ses01M_script01_3_M011,I'm sorry I don't really have much of an imagination.,-1
1441,Ses01M_script01_3_M012,"I'm sorry I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?  See, I didn't want to do it here I didn't on this porch, with this ring--I didn't want to win you away from anything.",-1
1442,Ses01M_script01_3_M013,So then he's gone.  You sure?,-1
1443,Ses01M_script01_3_M014,Why didn't you?,3
1444,Ses01M_script01_3_M015,You felt something that far back?,-1
1445,Ses01M_script01_3_M016,why didn't you let me know?,1

1450,Ses01M_script01_3_M021,"No, no, it's nothing like that.",2
1451,Ses01M_script01_3_M022,I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,2
1452,Ses01M_script01_3_M023,I don't know.,2
1453,Ses01M_script01_3_M024,It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,2
1454,Ses01M_script01_3_M025,you know over seas I was in command of the company?,2
1455,Ses01M_script01_3_M026,Well I lost them.,2
1456,Ses01M_script01_3_M027,Pretty much all.,2
1457,Ses01M_script01_3_M028,"Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",2
1458,Ses01M_script01_3_M029,"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",2
1459,Ses01M_script01_3_M030,He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,2
1460,Ses01M_script01_3_M031,"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",2
1461,Ses01M_script01_3_M032,"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...",2
1462,Ses01M_script01_3_M033,"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",2
1463,Ses01M_script01_3_M034,"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",2
1464,Ses01M_script01_3_M035,You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,2
1465,Ses01M_script01_3_M036,And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,2
1466,Ses01M_script01_3_M037,Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,2
1467,Ses01M_script01_3_M038,'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,2
1468,Ses01M_script01_3_M039,And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,2
1469,Ses01M_script01_3_M040,I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,2

1476,Ses01M_script02_1_F003,That's not your flashlight.,-1
1477,Ses01M_script02_1_F004,"It's ours; it's my flashlight, too.",-1
1478,Ses01M_script02_1_F005,"You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?",0
1479,Ses01M_script02_1_F006,Yeah.,-1
1480,Ses01M_script02_1_F007,No.,3
1481,Ses01M_script02_1_F008,I'm fine.,3
1482,Ses01M_script02_1_F009,I wonder if they can hear me talk,1
1483,Ses01M_script02_1_F010,I'm cold.,-1
1484,Ses01M_script02_1_F011,"It's after eleven, let's go home.",-1
1485,Ses01M_script02_1_F012,There is no point.,-1
1486,Ses01M_script02_1_F013,That's my point.,-1
1487,Ses01M_script02_1_F014,Then let's go.,0
1488,Ses01M_script02_1_F015,Not particularly.,-1
1489,Ses01M_script02_1_F016,"I just don't, it's stupid.",-1
1490,Ses01M_script02_1_F017,"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",0
1491,Ses01M_script02_1_F018,"I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.",-1
1492,Ses01M_script02_1_F019,"Oh, Augie.",-1
1493,Ses01M_script02_1_F020,I'm not.,-1
1494,Ses01M_script02_1_F021,Yes.,0
1495,Ses01M_script02_1_F022,"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",0
1496,Ses01M_script02_1_F023,We didn't see them the year before either.,0
1497,Ses01M_script02_1_F024,That's the wind.,-1
1498,Ses01M_script02_1_M000,"What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.",1
1499,Ses01M_script02_1_M001,"Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.",1
1500,Ses01M_script02_1_M002,"Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--",1
1501,Ses01M_script02_1_M003,"No, I think that's just foam.",-1
1502,Ses01M_script02_1_M004,"Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?",1
1503,Ses01M_script02_1_M005,"Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?",1
1504,Ses01M_script02_1_M006,My flashlight.  How could I forget my flashlight?  God--,-1
1505,Ses01M_script02_1_M007,Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?,3
1506,Ses01M_script02_1_M008,Whose is it?,-1
1507,Ses01M_script02_1_M009,"Oh, well, yeah of course.",3
1508,Ses01M_script02_1_M010,"Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.",3
1509,Ses01M_script02_1_M011,"Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.",3
1510,Ses01M_script02_1_M012,"It's a nice moon though, should stay full.  Do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember was it full last year?",-1
1511,Ses01M_script02_1_M013,Are you all right?  Are you okay?  You cold?  Do you want to my jacket? My jacket? No?,-1
1512,Ses01M_script02_1_M014,"You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.",1
1513,Ses01M_script02_1_M015,What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Huh?  You cold?,-1
1514,Ses01M_script02_1_M016,"Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.",1
1515,Ses01M_script02_1_M017,I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.,1
1516,Ses01M_script02_1_M018,"I wonder if they can hear me talking, you know.",-1
1517,Ses01M_script02_1_M019,Like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,-1
1518,Ses01M_script02_1_M020,Do you want my jacket?,-1
1519,Ses01M_script02_1_M021,What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?,-1
1520,Ses01M_script02_1_M022,Right.,3
1521,Ses01M_script02_1_M023,That's my point too.,3
1522,Ses01M_script02_1_M024,"No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.",-1
1523,Ses01M_script02_1_M025,Don't you want to see it?,-1
1524,Ses01M_script02_1_M026,Why not?,-1
1525,Ses01M_script02_1_M027,It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.,-1
1526,Ses01M_script02_1_M028,People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,0
1527,Ses01M_script02_1_M029,Yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it's like spawning or mating or something.  This is like the highlight of their little fish lives.  It's like life's last orgy.,-1
1528,Ses01M_script02_1_M030,"Yeah, they do.",3
1529,Ses01M_script02_1_M031,"Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.",1
1530,Ses01M_script02_1_M032,"It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.",1
1531,Ses01M_script02_1_M033,For real?,-1
1532,Ses01M_script02_1_M034,All right.,-1
1533,Ses01M_script02_1_M035,"I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...",-1
1534,Ses01M_script02_1_M036,And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.,-1
1535,Ses01M_script02_1_M037,We just weren't in a good spot though.,3
1536,Ses01M_script02_1_M038,We just weren't in a good spot I'm telling you this is a much better spot.,-1
1537,Ses01M_script02_1_M039,"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",3
1538,Ses01M_script02_1_M040,"Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...",1
1539,Ses01M_script02_1_M041,"They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...",1
1540,Ses01M_script02_1_M042,They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...,1
1541,Ses01M_script02_1_M043,Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...,1
1542,Ses01M_script02_1_M044,"And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...",1
1543,Ses01M_script02_1_M045,It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.,1
1544,Ses01M_script02_1_M046,"It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.",1
1545,Ses01M_script02_2_F000,That's the wind.,3
1546,Ses01M_script02_2_F001,About what?,-1
1547,Ses01M_script02_2_F002,I think it's ridiculous.,-1
1548,Ses01M_script02_2_F003,It's a PR.,-1
1549,Ses01M_script02_2_F004,Somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach.,-1
1550,Ses01M_script02_2_F005,They're all told the same thing.,-1
1551,Ses01M_script02_2_F006,"Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.",-1
1552,Ses01M_script02_2_F007,"Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.",-1
1553,Ses01M_script02_2_F008,Their life will start then.,-1
1554,Ses01M_script02_2_F009,I'm sorry it still just fish to me.,-1
1555,Ses01M_script02_2_F010,"Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",0
1556,Ses01M_script02_2_F011,"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",0
1557,Ses01M_script02_2_F012,"Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.",-1
1558,Ses01M_script02_2_F013,"Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?",0
1559,Ses01M_script02_2_F014,Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,0
1560,Ses01M_script02_2_F015,No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,0
1561,Ses01M_script02_2_F016,"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",0
1562,Ses01M_script02_2_F017,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,-1
1563,Ses01M_script02_2_F018,"I did want to see it I still do, I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.",-1
1564,Ses01M_script02_2_F019,Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.,3
1565,Ses01M_script02_2_F020,We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.,-1
1566,Ses01M_script02_2_F021,"While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.",-1
1567,Ses01M_script02_2_F022,"And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",2
1568,Ses01M_script02_2_F023,"Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.",-1
1569,Ses01M_script02_2_F024,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,2
1570,Ses01M_script02_2_F025,No.,2
1571,Ses01M_script02_2_F026,No.,2
1572,Ses01M_script02_2_F027,No.,-1

1574,Ses01M_script02_2_F029,No.,-1
1575,Ses01M_script02_2_F030,I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,0
1576,Ses01M_script02_2_F031,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,0
1577,Ses01M_script02_2_F032,"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",0
1578,Ses01M_script02_2_F033,This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,2
1579,Ses01M_script02_2_F034,This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,2
1580,Ses01M_script02_2_F035,"I know that Augie, I really do.",2
1581,Ses01M_script02_2_F036,"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",2
1582,Ses01M_script02_2_F037,I didn't say that.,2
1583,Ses01M_script02_2_F038,Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,-1
1584,Ses01M_script02_2_F039,"Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?",-1
1585,Ses01M_script02_2_F040,"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",2
1586,Ses01M_script02_2_F041,So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.,-1
1587,Ses01M_script02_2_F042,Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.,-1
1588,Ses01M_script02_2_F043,"Augie, you brought refreshments.",-1
1589,Ses01M_script02_2_F044,I guess we don't need glasses.,1
1590,Ses01M_script02_2_F045,I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.,1
1591,Ses01M_script02_2_F046,"Augie, I'm sorry.",2
1592,Ses01M_script02_2_F047,Or not.,3
1593,Ses01M_script02_2_M000,They're out there swimming right now...,-1
1594,Ses01M_script02_2_M001,...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...,1

1596,Ses01M_script02_2_M003,"Well, so?  What do you think?",1
1597,Ses01M_script02_2_M004,About what I was saying.,-1
1598,Ses01M_script02_2_M005,It certainly is not.  It's like slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,-1
1599,Ses01M_script02_2_M006,"It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people.",-1
1600,Ses01M_script02_2_M007,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
1601,Ses01M_script02_2_M008,Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?,3
1602,Ses01M_script02_2_M009,"Okay, well then what's bugging you?",-1
1603,Ses01M_script02_2_M010,"Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.",-1
1604,Ses01M_script02_2_M011,And then we go home and they go home.,-1
1605,Ses01M_script02_2_M012,Why not?,-1
1606,Ses01M_script02_2_M013,We missed them twice.,3

1608,Ses01M_script02_2_M015,"Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards",-1
1609,Ses01M_script02_2_M016,and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.,-1
1610,Ses01M_script02_2_M017,Of course not.,-1
1611,Ses01M_script02_2_M018,"Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.",-1
1612,Ses01M_script02_2_M019,"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",3
1613,Ses01M_script02_2_M020,"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",3

1628,Ses01M_script02_2_M035,You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,0
1629,Ses01M_script02_2_M036,"You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think ""Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska.""",-1
1630,Ses01M_script02_2_M037,"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",2

1671,Ses01M_script03_1_F023,"Well, that's serious enough isn't it?",-1
1672,Ses01M_script03_1_F024,I think you're talking nonsense.,1
1673,Ses01M_script03_1_F025,Hmm.,-1

1681,Ses01M_script03_1_F033,It went on intermittently for days.,-1

1684,Ses01M_script03_1_F036,The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER],1
1685,Ses01M_script03_1_F037,Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...,1

1706,Ses01M_script03_1_M016,"Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?",1
1707,Ses01M_script03_1_M017,"You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.",1
1708,Ses01M_script03_1_M018,"Oh you know all those superficial philosophers. We must laugh at them, be flippant.",-1
1709,Ses01M_script03_1_M019,Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.,1
1710,Ses01M_script03_1_M020,Oh yes.  .,-1
1711,Ses01M_script03_1_M021,We are figures of fun all right,1

1721,Ses01M_script03_1_M031,"See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.",1
1722,Ses01M_script03_1_M032,You could run off with all the men in a world. I won't say a word.  Just as long as you love me best.,-1
1723,Ses01M_script03_1_M033,Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?,1
1724,Ses01M_script03_1_M034,The one when you put that little wooden painted snake in my bed?,-1
1725,Ses01M_script03_1_M035,It was a horrible thing I hated it.,-1
1726,Ses01M_script03_1_M036,Of course how long did that row last?,-1
1727,Ses01M_script03_1_M037,But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,1
1728,Ses01M_script03_1_M038,Oh that was a rouser wasn't it?,-1
1729,Ses01M_script03_1_M039,I will never forget the look on his face.,1

1731,Ses01M_script03_1_M041,We were very much younger then.,1
1732,Ses01M_script03_1_M042,"However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",-1

1734,Ses01M_script03_2_F001,Very much sillier.,-1
1735,Ses01M_script03_2_F002,Oh you knew there was nothing in that.,-1
1736,Ses01M_script03_2_F003,Presents? It was a trivial little broach.,-1
1737,Ses01M_script03_2_F004,Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.,-1
1738,Ses01M_script03_2_F005,I did not you worked whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,-1
1739,Ses01M_script03_2_F006,"Well, what of it?",3
1740,Ses01M_script03_2_F007,"It gave him a lot, a great deal of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.",-1
1741,Ses01M_script03_2_F008,If you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd never known a thing about it.,-1
1742,Ses01M_script03_2_F009,I'm bored with this conversation.,-1
1743,Ses01M_script03_2_F010,"No, thank you.",3

1745,Ses01M_script03_2_F012,I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,-1
1746,Ses01M_script03_2_F013,"I just, I just think it's becoming a habit with you.",-1
1747,Ses01M_script03_2_F014,Do be quiet.,-1
1748,Ses01M_script03_2_F015,"Don't be stupid, what?",0
1749,Ses01M_script03_2_F016,"No, darling I'm just making myself fascinating for you.",-1
1750,Ses01M_script03_2_F017,Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?,0
1751,Ses01M_script03_2_F018,"Oh no, it isn't.",-1
1752,Ses01M_script03_2_F019,"Don't be stupid, shut up.",-1
1753,Ses01M_script03_2_F020,"Oh, well that's funny.  It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",-1
1754,Ses01M_script03_2_F021,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",-1
1755,Ses01M_script03_2_F022,They sting.,0

1757,Ses01M_script03_2_F024,"Yes, I did quite a lot.",0
1758,Ses01M_script03_2_F025,"Oh, mind you own business.",0
1759,Ses01M_script03_2_F026,"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",0
1760,Ses01M_script03_2_F027,You always had a weak head.,0
1761,Ses01M_script03_2_F028,"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",0
1762,Ses01M_script03_2_F029,Shut up.,0
1763,Ses01M_script03_2_F030,Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?,0
1764,Ses01M_script03_2_F031,Why?,0
1765,Ses01M_script03_2_F032,There are no people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,-1
1766,Ses01M_script03_2_F033,They are away in Tunis.,0
1767,Ses01M_script03_2_F034,"Turn it on again, please.",0
1768,Ses01M_script03_2_F035,Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,0
1769,Ses01M_script03_2_F036,I won't.,0

1773,Ses01M_script03_2_F040,This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,0
1774,Ses01M_script03_2_F041,"Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.",0
1775,Ses01M_script03_2_M000,[LAUGHTER],-1
1776,Ses01M_script03_2_M001,We were very much younger then.,-1
1777,Ses01M_script03_2_M002,Mmhmm.,-1
1778,Ses01M_script03_2_M003,"However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",-1
1779,Ses01M_script03_2_M004,I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,-1
1780,Ses01M_script03_2_M005,It was bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,-1
1781,Ses01M_script03_2_M006,You sent out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,-1
1782,Ses01M_script03_2_M007,"Well, you let him kiss you.  You said you did.",-1
1783,Ses01M_script03_2_M008,What of it?,-1
1784,Ses01M_script03_2_M009,And what about me?,-1
1785,Ses01M_script03_2_M010,That's a nice point of view I must say.,-1
1786,Ses01M_script03_2_M011,So am I.  I'm bored stiff.  You want some brandy?,-1
1787,Ses01M_script03_2_M012,"I'll have a little, I think.",3
1788,Ses01M_script03_2_M013,"Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.",3
1789,Ses01M_script03_2_M014,You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.,-1
1790,Ses01M_script03_2_M015,"Hmm.  Well, you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment, okay?",-1
1791,Ses01M_script03_2_M016,"Really, Amanda.",-1
1792,Ses01M_script03_2_M017,Nothing.,-1
1793,Ses01M_script03_2_M018,Are you going out somewhere dear?,3
1794,Ses01M_script03_2_M019,That reply has broken my heart.,-1
1795,Ses01M_script03_2_M020,As matter the fact that's perfectly true.,-1
1796,Ses01M_script03_2_M021,"Yes, it is.",-1
1797,Ses01M_script03_2_M022,"You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.",0
1798,Ses01M_script03_2_M023,"You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.",0
1799,Ses01M_script03_2_M024,Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.,0
1800,Ses01M_script03_2_M025,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,0
1801,Ses01M_script03_2_M026,I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,0
1802,Ses01M_script03_2_M027,"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",0
1803,Ses01M_script03_2_M028,I am not in the least bit drunk.,0
1804,Ses01M_script03_2_M029,I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,0
1805,Ses01M_script03_2_M030,"Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",0
1806,Ses01M_script03_2_M031,That's a very good idea I think I will.,0
1807,Ses01M_script03_2_M032,Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.,0
1808,Ses01M_script03_2_M033,Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.,0
1809,Ses01M_script03_2_M034,This is no time a year for Tunis.,0
1810,Ses01M_script03_2_M035,I will do no such thing.,0
1811,Ses01M_script03_2_M036,Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,0
1812,Ses01M_script03_2_M037,Turn it off.,0
1813,Ses01M_script03_2_M038,Amanda listen. Listen.,0
1814,Ses01M_script03_2_M039,That's very amusing indeed.,0
1815,Ses01M_script03_2_M040,"You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",0
1816,Ses01M_script03_2_M041,You're not going like this.,0
1817,Ses01M_script03_2_M042,No you're not.,0
1818,Ses01M_script03_2_M043,Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.,0
1819,Ses02F_impro01_F000,"Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.",3
1820,Ses02F_impro01_F001,My--my original birth certificate?  But I don't carry that with me.,-1
1821,Ses02F_impro01_F002,"Well, I have my driver's license, does that work?",-1
1822,Ses02F_impro01_F003,No it doesn't say it on the form.,-1
1823,Ses02F_impro01_F004,"I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification.",-1
1824,Ses02F_impro01_F005,I mean if I had known--I would have brought it.,-1
1825,Ses02F_impro01_F006,"Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is.",-1
1826,Ses02F_impro01_F007,It's lunch hour.,-1
1827,Ses02F_impro01_F008,"Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.",-1
1828,Ses02F_impro01_F009,I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.,-1
1829,Ses02F_impro01_F010,"But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me.",-1
1830,Ses02F_impro01_F011,And I can give you my social--,-1
1831,Ses02F_impro01_F012,"Well, I can give you my Social Security Number.",-1
1832,Ses02F_impro01_F013,And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.,-1
1833,Ses02F_impro01_F014,I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.,-1
1834,Ses02F_impro01_F015,"Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me.",-1
1835,Ses02F_impro01_F016,Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I-,-1
1836,Ses02F_impro01_F017,"I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back.",-1
1837,Ses02F_impro01_F018,"Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?",0
1838,Ses02F_impro01_F019,"Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.",0
1839,Ses02F_impro01_F020,With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.,0
1840,Ses02F_impro01_F021,"Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.",0
1841,Ses02F_impro01_F022,Do you have a supervisor?,-1

1848,Ses02F_impro01_M005,"Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh...",-1
1849,Ses02F_impro01_M006,Right.  It's the D.M.V..,-1
1850,Ses02F_impro01_M007,"I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?",-1
1851,Ses02F_impro01_M008,"Alright, I don't know what to tell you right.",-1
1852,Ses02F_impro01_M009,"I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can-",-1
1853,Ses02F_impro01_M010,I can't.,-1
1854,Ses02F_impro01_M011,"I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to-",-1
1855,Ses02F_impro01_M012,"No, it's--",-1
1856,Ses02F_impro01_M013,"Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need--",-1
1857,Ses02F_impro01_M014,"Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--",-1
1858,Ses02F_impro01_M015,I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry.,-1
1859,Ses02F_impro01_M016,The line--,-1
1860,Ses02F_impro01_M017,"Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting",0
1861,Ses02F_impro01_M018,"I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--",-1
1862,Ses02F_impro01_M019,"You know, Official documentation--",0
1863,Ses02F_impro01_M020,"No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--",-1
1864,Ses02F_impro01_M021,"But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?",-1
1865,Ses02F_impro01_M022,"All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.",-1
1866,Ses02F_impro01_M023,"So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know.",-1
1867,Ses02F_impro01_M024,I am the supervisor.  So--,-1
1868,Ses02F_impro02_F000,It's almost time for me to go.,2
1869,Ses02F_impro02_F001,"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--",2

Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?",-1

1982,Ses02F_impro04_M011,... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--,3
1983,Ses02F_impro04_M012,"Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.

2223,Ses02F_script01_1_F029,You never did.,-1
2224,Ses02F_script01_1_F030,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,-1
2225,Ses02F_script01_1_F031,"Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.",-1
2226,Ses02F_script01_1_F032,"I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.",-1
2227,Ses02F_script01_1_F033,"I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.",-1
2228,Ses02F_script01_1_F034,I just--give it some more thought.,-1
2229,Ses02F_script01_1_F035,What the hell is this?,-1
2230,Ses02F_script01_1_F036,Are you crazy?,0
2231,Ses02F_script01_1_F037,What about the business?  What the hell is this?,0
2232,Ses02F_script01_1_F038,Must you be inspired?,0
2233,Ses02F_script01_1_F039,"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",-1
2234,Ses02F_script01_1_F040,"Well, you don't want to think like that.",0
2235,Ses02F_script01_1_F041,"All right, but just don't go thinkin' like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for?  I mean, the whole thing is for you, Chris.  The whole shootin' match is for you.",-1
2236,Ses02F_script01_1_F042,"All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?",-1
2237,Ses02F_script01_1_F043,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
2238,Ses02F_script01_1_F044,I can see that.,2
2239,Ses02F_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,-1
2240,Ses02F_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,-1
2241,Ses02F_script01_1_M002,About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,-1
2242,Ses02F_script01_1_M003,"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",-1
2243,Ses02F_script01_1_M004,No.  I thought it was best to leave him alone.,-1
2244,Ses02F_script01_1_M005,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,-1
2245,Ses02F_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,-1
2246,Ses02F_script01_1_M007,"I don't know the meaning of it.  But, I know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",-1
2247,Ses02F_script01_1_M008,"Being dishonest with him.  I mean, that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",-1
2248,Ses02F_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,-1
2249,Ses02F_script01_1_M010,"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore?",-1
2250,Ses02F_script01_1_M011,Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,0
2251,Ses02F_script01_1_M012,We've got to say it to him.,-1
2252,Ses02F_script01_1_M013,"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",0
2253,Ses02F_script01_1_M014,"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",-1
2254,Ses02F_script01_1_M015,All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,-1
2255,Ses02F_script01_1_M016,You know.,-1
2256,Ses02F_script01_1_M017,I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,3
2257,Ses02F_script01_1_M018,You know it's not only my business.,-1
2258,Ses02F_script01_1_M019,So it's all right then?,-1
2259,Ses02F_script01_1_M020,I'll go ahead with it?,-1
2260,Ses02F_script01_1_M021,"Well, then it isn't just my business--",0
2261,Ses02F_script01_1_M022,"Ah, sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  I mean, isn't it your business too if I tell Dad and flips--freaks out about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",-1
2262,Ses02F_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl.,0
2263,Ses02F_script01_1_M024,"I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time.",-1
2264,Ses02F_script01_1_M025,To hell with that.,0
2265,Ses02F_script01_1_M026,I wanted to get this settled first.,-1
2266,Ses02F_script01_1_M027,"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",2
2267,Ses02F_script01_1_M028,"So what, I'm not fast with women.",-1
2268,Ses02F_script01_1_M029,Because it is.,3
2269,Ses02F_script01_1_M030,"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I mean, I grew up next door to her.",-1
2270,Ses02F_script01_1_M031,"These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",-1
2271,Ses02F_script01_1_M032,"All right.  All right, then, Mom.",-1
2272,Ses02F_script01_1_M033,I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,-1
2273,Ses02F_script01_1_M034,"But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",-1
2274,Ses02F_script01_1_M035,I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.,-1
2275,Ses02F_script01_1_M036,I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,0
2276,Ses02F_script01_1_M037,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0
2277,Ses02F_script01_1_M038,"Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",0
2278,Ses02F_script01_1_M039,"I want a family.  I want kids.  I want something that I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now, where do I find it?",-1
2279,Ses02F_script01_1_M040,"Yes, on this I would.",3
2280,Ses02F_script01_1_M041,Then help me stay here.,-1
2281,Ses02F_script01_1_M042,"I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here.",-1
2282,Ses02F_script01_1_M043,I am thinkin' that way.,3
2283,Ses02F_script01_1_M044,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",3
2284,Ses02F_script01_2_F000,Why did he invite her here?,-1
2285,Ses02F_script01_2_F001,She's been in New York for three and half years.  Why all of a sudden?,-1
2286,Ses02F_script01_2_F002,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,-1
2287,Ses02F_script01_2_F003,She's not-,-1
2288,Ses02F_script01_2_F004,-he's not gonna marry her.,-1
2289,Ses02F_script01_2_F005,It's got that all about it.,0
2290,Ses02F_script01_2_F006,"What's going on here, Joe?",-1
2291,Ses02F_script01_2_F007,"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",-1
2292,Ses02F_script01_2_F008,"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",-1
2293,Ses02F_script01_2_F009,"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",-1
2294,Ses02F_script01_2_F010,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",-1
2295,Ses02F_script01_2_F011,I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,-1
2296,Ses02F_script01_2_F012,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",0
2297,Ses02F_script01_2_F013,But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,0
2298,Ses02F_script01_2_F014,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.",-1
2299,Ses02F_script01_2_F015,"Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.",-1
2300,Ses02F_script01_2_F016,"You, above all, have to believe.",-1
2301,Ses02F_script01_2_F017,Just--just don't stop believing.,-1
2302,Ses02F_script01_2_F018,I can't help it.,-1
2303,Ses02F_script01_2_M000,Why does that bother you?,-1
2304,Ses02F_script01_2_M001,"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",3
2305,Ses02F_script01_2_M002,What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,3
2306,Ses02F_script01_2_M003,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,-1
2307,Ses02F_script01_2_M004,How do you know he's even thinking of it?,3
2308,Ses02F_script01_2_M005,"Well, so what?",3
2309,Ses02F_script01_2_M006,"Now, listen Kate.",3
2310,Ses02F_script01_2_M007,You can't read her mind.,3
2311,Ses02F_script01_2_M008,How do you know why she's waited?,3
2312,Ses02F_script01_2_M009,"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",-1
2313,Ses02F_script01_2_M010,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",-1
2314,Ses02F_script01_2_M011,But Kate--,-1
2315,Ses02F_script01_2_M012,Calm yourself.,-1
2316,Ses02F_script01_2_M013,Calm yourself.,-1
2317,Ses02F_script01_2_M014,All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.,-1
2318,Ses02F_script01_2_M015,What?- Why- Why me above all?,-1
2319,Ses02F_script01_2_M016,What does that mean?  Me above all?,0
2320,Ses02F_script01_2_M017,Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,0
2321,Ses02F_script01_2_M018,What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,0
2322,Ses02F_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,-1
2323,Ses02F_script01_3_F001,It's all right.  It's a good thing.,-1
2324,Ses02F_script01_3_F002,"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",-1
2325,Ses02F_script01_3_F003,"No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.",-1
2326,Ses02F_script01_3_F004,"Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",-1
2327,Ses02F_script01_3_F005,"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",-1
2328,Ses02F_script01_3_F006,"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",-1
2329,Ses02F_script01_3_F007,"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",-1
2330,Ses02F_script01_3_F008,"Well,",-1
2331,Ses02F_script01_3_F009,"from her point of view, why else would I come?",2
2332,Ses02F_script01_3_F010,I--I guess this is why I came.,-1
2333,Ses02F_script01_3_F011,"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",-1
2334,Ses02F_script01_3_F012,I almost got married two years ago.,1
2335,Ses02F_script01_3_F013,You started to write me and--,1
2336,Ses02F_script01_3_F014,Every day since.,1
2337,Ses02F_script01_3_F015,"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.",-1
2338,Ses02F_script01_3_F016,I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,1
2339,Ses02F_script01_3_F017,Not like that you're not.,-1
2340,Ses02F_script01_3_F018,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",-1
2341,Ses02F_script01_3_F019,"No.  What is it, your mother?",-1
2342,Ses02F_script01_3_F020,"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",2
2343,Ses02F_script01_3_F021,You've gotta tell me.,2
2344,Ses02F_script01_3_F022,It wouldn't work this way.,2
2345,Ses02F_script01_3_F023,"Yeah, sure.",2
2346,Ses02F_script01_3_F024,How many?,2
2347,Ses02F_script01_3_F025,"Oh, gee.",2
2348,Ses02F_script01_3_F026,You still feel that way?,2
2349,Ses02F_script01_3_F027,"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.",-1
2350,Ses02F_script01_3_F028,"I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",-1
2351,Ses02F_script01_3_F029,What'll I do with a fortune?,1
2352,Ses02F_script01_3_M000,"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",-1
2353,Ses02F_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came?,3
2354,Ses02F_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
2355,Ses02F_script01_3_M003,Oh.,-1
2356,Ses02F_script01_3_M004,What?,-1
2357,Ses02F_script01_3_M005,"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",-1
2358,Ses02F_script01_3_M006,"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",-1
2359,Ses02F_script01_3_M007,"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",-1
2360,Ses02F_script01_3_M008,I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,-1
2361,Ses02F_script01_3_M009,I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,-1
2362,Ses02F_script01_3_M010,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",1
2363,Ses02F_script01_3_M011,And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,-1
2364,Ses02F_script01_3_M012,Why didn't you?,-1
2365,Ses02F_script01_3_M013,You felt something that far back?,-1
2366,Ses02F_script01_3_M014,"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",-1
2367,Ses02F_script01_3_M015,"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",-1
2368,Ses02F_script01_3_M016,"oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",-1
2369,Ses02F_script01_3_M017,"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",-1
2370,Ses02F_script01_3_M018,I kissed you.,-1
2371,Ses02F_script01_3_M019,Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,-1
2372,Ses02F_script01_3_M020,No.  Nothing like that.,2
2373,Ses02F_script01_3_M021,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",2
2374,Ses02F_script01_3_M022,I don't know how to start.,2
2375,Ses02F_script01_3_M023,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",2
2376,Ses02F_script01_3_M024,"Well, I lost them.",2
2377,Ses02F_script01_3_M025,Just about all.,2
2378,Ses02F_script01_3_M026,It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,2
2379,Ses02F_script01_3_M027,"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",2
2380,Ses02F_script01_3_M028,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",2
2381,Ses02F_script01_3_M029,"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",2
2382,Ses02F_script01_3_M030,"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",2
2383,Ses02F_script01_3_M031,Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,2
2384,Ses02F_script01_3_M032,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",2
2385,Ses02F_script01_3_M033,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",2
2386,Ses02F_script01_3_M034,Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,2
2387,Ses02F_script01_3_M035,I want you now Annie.,-1
2388,Ses02F_script01_3_M036,"I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.",-1
2389,Ses02F_script02_1_F000,Fine.,-1
2390,Ses02F_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,3
2391,Ses02F_script02_1_F002,That's not your flashlight.,-1
2392,Ses02F_script02_1_F003,It's ours.  It's mine too.,-1
2393,Ses02F_script02_1_F004,"You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?",-1
2394,Ses02F_script02_1_F005,Yeah.,3
2395,Ses02F_script02_1_F006,I'm cold.,-1
2396,Ses02F_script02_1_F007,"It's after eleven, let's just go home.",-1
2397,Ses02F_script02_1_F008,There is no point in coming down here.,-1
2398,Ses02F_script02_1_F009,That's my point.,-1
2399,Ses02F_script02_1_F010,"So, let's go.",-1
2400,Ses02F_script02_1_F011,Not particularly.,-1
2401,Ses02F_script02_1_F012,I just don't.  It's stupid.,-1
2402,Ses02F_script02_1_F013,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",-1
2403,Ses02F_script02_1_F014,"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",-1
2404,Ses02F_script02_1_F015,"Ah, Augie.",-1
2405,Ses02F_script02_1_F016,I'm just not.,-1
2406,Ses02F_script02_1_F017,Yeah.,-1
2407,Ses02F_script02_1_F018,"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",-1
2408,Ses02F_script02_1_F019,We didn't see them the first time either.,3
2409,Ses02F_script02_1_F020,That's the wind.,-1
2410,Ses02F_script02_1_F021,About what?,3
2411,Ses02F_script02_1_F022,It's ridiculous.,-1
2412,Ses02F_script02_1_M000,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,1
2413,Ses02F_script02_1_M001,"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",1
2414,Ses02F_script02_1_M002,"I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.",1
2415,Ses02F_script02_1_M003,How you doing?,1
2416,Ses02F_script02_1_M004,Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,1
2417,Ses02F_script02_1_M005,"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",1
2418,Ses02F_script02_1_M006,"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",1
2419,Ses02F_script02_1_M007,"You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",-1
2420,Ses02F_script02_1_M008,Who's is it?,-1
2421,Ses02F_script02_1_M009,"Oh, well sure.",3
2422,Ses02F_script02_1_M010,"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",3
2423,Ses02F_script02_1_M011,How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,-1
2424,Ses02F_script02_1_M012,"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",3
2425,Ses02F_script02_1_M013,"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",3
2426,Ses02F_script02_1_M014,"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",1
2427,Ses02F_script02_1_M015,I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,1
2428,Ses02F_script02_1_M016,You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,1
2429,Ses02F_script02_1_M017,Do you want my jacket?,3
2430,Ses02F_script02_1_M018,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.,-1
2431,Ses02F_script02_1_M019,Right.,3
2432,Ses02F_script02_1_M020,That's my point too.,3
2433,Ses02F_script02_1_M021,No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,3
2434,Ses02F_script02_1_M022,Why not?,-1
2435,Ses02F_script02_1_M023,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.",-1
2436,Ses02F_script02_1_M024,"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",1
2437,Ses02F_script02_1_M025,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",1
2438,Ses02F_script02_1_M026,this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,1
2439,Ses02F_script02_1_M027,Yeah they do.,-1
2440,Ses02F_script02_1_M028,Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,1
2441,Ses02F_script02_1_M029,There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,-1
2442,Ses02F_script02_1_M030,For real?,-1
2443,Ses02F_script02_1_M031,"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",3
2444,Ses02F_script02_1_M032,"And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.",-1
2445,Ses02F_script02_1_M033,We weren't in a good spot.,3
2446,Ses02F_script02_1_M034,"We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.",-1
2447,Ses02F_script02_1_M035,There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,1
2448,Ses02F_script02_1_M036,"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",1
2449,Ses02F_script02_1_M037,"Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.",-1
2450,Ses02F_script02_1_M038,"They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-",-1
2451,Ses02F_script02_1_M039,"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",1
2452,Ses02F_script02_1_M040,It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,1
2453,Ses02F_script02_1_M041,"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",1
2454,Ses02F_script02_1_M042,"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",1
2455,Ses02F_script02_1_M043,"Well, so what do you think?",3
2456,Ses02F_script02_1_M044,What I was saying.,3
2457,Ses02F_script02_2_F000,About what?,3
2458,Ses02F_script02_2_F001,It's ridiculous.,-1
2459,Ses02F_script02_2_F002,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,-1
2460,Ses02F_script02_2_F003,"Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.",-1
2461,Ses02F_script02_2_F004,"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",-1
2462,Ses02F_script02_2_F005,"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",0
2463,Ses02F_script02_2_F006,We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,0
2464,Ses02F_script02_2_F007,"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",-1
2465,Ses02F_script02_2_F008,"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",-1
2466,Ses02F_script02_2_F009,Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,-1
2467,Ses02F_script02_2_F010,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",-1
2468,Ses02F_script02_2_F011,"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",0
2469,Ses02F_script02_2_F012,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,-1
2470,Ses02F_script02_2_F013,I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,-1
2471,Ses02F_script02_2_F014,"For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",-1
2472,Ses02F_script02_2_F015,"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",2
2473,Ses02F_script02_2_F016,"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",2
2474,Ses02F_script02_2_F017,"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",2
2475,Ses02F_script02_2_F018,"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",2
2476,Ses02F_script02_2_F019,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",2
2477,Ses02F_script02_2_F020,I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,2
2478,Ses02F_script02_2_F021,No.,2
2479,Ses02F_script02_2_F022,No.,2
2480,Ses02F_script02_2_F023,No. No.,-1
2481,Ses02F_script02_2_F024,No.,2
2482,Ses02F_script02_2_F025,No.,-1
2483,Ses02F_script02_2_F026,No.,-1
2484,Ses02F_script02_2_F027,No.,-1
2485,Ses02F_script02_2_F028,I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,-1
2486,Ses02F_script02_2_F029,This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,-1
2487,Ses02F_script02_2_F030,"Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",-1
2488,Ses02F_script02_2_F031,Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,2
2489,Ses02F_script02_2_F032,"I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",-1
2490,Ses02F_script02_2_F033,"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",2
2491,Ses02F_script02_2_F034,"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",2
2492,Ses02F_script02_2_F035,I didn't say that.,2
2493,Ses02F_script02_2_F036,"Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",-1
2494,Ses02F_script02_2_F037,"Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?",-1
2495,Ses02F_script02_2_F038,You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,2
2496,Ses02F_script02_2_F039,"Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",-1
2497,Ses02F_script02_2_F040,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.",-1
2498,Ses02F_script02_2_F041,"Augie, you brought refreshments.",1
2499,Ses02F_script02_2_F042,"Well, then we don't need glasses.",1
2500,Ses02F_script02_2_F043,No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.,1
2501,Ses02F_script02_2_F044,"Augie, I'm sorry.",2
2502,Ses02F_script02_2_F045,Or not.,1
2503,Ses02F_script02_2_M000,"Well, so what do you think?",1
2504,Ses02F_script02_2_M001,What I was saying.,3
2505,Ses02F_script02_2_M002,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,3
2506,Ses02F_script02_2_M003,"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",3
2507,Ses02F_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
2508,Ses02F_script02_2_M005,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",3
2509,Ses02F_script02_2_M006,"Well, what's bugging you?",-1
2510,Ses02F_script02_2_M007,"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",3
2511,Ses02F_script02_2_M008,Why not?,-1
2512,Ses02F_script02_2_M009,We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,3
2513,Ses02F_script02_2_M010,"Well, we'll see them this year.",3
2514,Ses02F_script02_2_M011,I thought you wanted to see it.,-1
2515,Ses02F_script02_2_M012,"No, of course not.",-1
2516,Ses02F_script02_2_M013,It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,3
2517,Ses02F_script02_2_M014,"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",-1
2518,Ses02F_script02_2_M015,"I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.",-1
2519,Ses02F_script02_2_M016,"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",3
2520,Ses02F_script02_2_M017,"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",3
2521,Ses02F_script02_2_M018,Wait a minute.  I've got it.,3
2522,Ses02F_script02_2_M019,"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",3
2523,Ses02F_script02_2_M020,"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",3
2524,Ses02F_script02_2_M021,"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",3
2525,Ses02F_script02_2_M022,You want me to go get some champagne?,3
2526,Ses02F_script02_2_M023,Take off our shoes?,3
2527,Ses02F_script02_2_M024,"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",-1
2528,Ses02F_script02_2_M025,You wanna get married again?,-1
2529,Ses02F_script02_2_M026,What?  What?  You want a divorce?,-1
2530,Ses02F_script02_2_M027,A vacation?,-1
2531,Ses02F_script02_2_M028,"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",-1
2532,Ses02F_script02_2_M029,"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",0
2533,Ses02F_script02_2_M030,"No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",-1
2534,Ses02F_script02_2_M031,"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",2
2535,Ses02F_script02_2_M032,"'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",-1
2536,Ses02F_script02_2_M033,"Yes, it is.",3
2537,Ses02F_script02_2_M034,Right.,3
2538,Ses02F_script02_2_M035,"I know, me neither.",2
2539,Ses02F_script02_2_M036,I'm doing the best I can.,2
2540,Ses02F_script02_2_M037,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,2
2541,Ses02F_script02_2_M038,"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",2
2542,Ses02F_script02_2_M039,Yeah?,-1
2543,Ses02F_script02_2_M040,"Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",-1
2544,Ses02F_script02_2_M041,"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",1
2545,Ses02F_script02_2_M042,"Well, look what we have here.",1
2546,Ses02F_script02_2_M043,It's not champagne.,1
2547,Ses02F_script02_2_M044,You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?,-1
2548,Ses02F_script02_2_M045,Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,1
2549,Ses02F_script02_2_M046,Or not.,1
2550,Ses02F_script03_1_F000,Do you think it's them?,-1
2551,Ses02F_script03_1_F001,"Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",-1
2552,Ses02F_script03_1_F002,What're we gonna do?,-1
2553,Ses02F_script03_1_F003,"Now and always, sweet.",-1
2554,Ses02F_script03_1_F004,It was bound to come sooner or later.,-1
2555,Ses02F_script03_1_F005,"Ah, it send shivers up my spine.",1
2556,Ses02F_script03_1_F006,Behave exquisitely.,1
2557,Ses02F_script03_1_F007,"Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.",1
2558,Ses02F_script03_1_F008,What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,1
2559,Ses02F_script03_1_F009,It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,1
2560,Ses02F_script03_1_F010,"Yes, meaning just that.",1
2561,Ses02F_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,-1
2562,Ses02F_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,3
2563,Ses02F_script03_1_F013,"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",3
2564,Ses02F_script03_1_F014,"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",3
2565,Ses02F_script03_1_F015,"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",3
2566,Ses02F_script03_1_F016,"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",3
2567,Ses02F_script03_1_F017,"Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",3
2568,Ses02F_script03_1_F018,"That's serious enough, isn't it?",-1
2569,Ses02F_script03_1_F019,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",1
2570,Ses02F_script03_1_F020,"Elliott, worms don't pop.",1
2571,Ses02F_script03_1_F021,"Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",1
2572,Ses02F_script03_1_F022,Which particular one?,1
2573,Ses02F_script03_1_F023,Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,1
2574,Ses02F_script03_1_F024,"Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",1
2575,Ses02F_script03_1_F025,It went in intermittently for days.,1
2576,Ses02F_script03_1_F026,It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,1
2577,Ses02F_script03_1_F027,That was the first time you ever hit me.,3
2578,Ses02F_script03_1_F028,"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",1
2579,Ses02F_script03_1_F029,It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.,1
2580,Ses02F_script03_1_F030,And very much sillier.,-1
2581,Ses02F_script03_1_M000,Good God.,-1
2582,Ses02F_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,3
2583,Ses02F_script03_1_M002,"Must be them, then.",-1
2584,Ses02F_script03_1_M003,"We're all right, darling, aren't we?  Whatever happens.",-1
2585,Ses02F_script03_1_M004,I don't care then.,3
2586,Ses02F_script03_1_M005,Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,3
2587,Ses02F_script03_1_M006,What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,-1
2588,Ses02F_script03_1_M007,With the most perfect poise?,3
2589,Ses02F_script03_1_M008,Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?,3
2590,Ses02F_script03_1_M009,"Oh, darling, don't say that.",3
2591,Ses02F_script03_1_M010,"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",3
2592,Ses02F_script03_1_M011,"Oh, what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",-1
2593,Ses02F_script03_1_M012,"You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.",3
2594,Ses02F_script03_1_M013,All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.,3
2595,Ses02F_script03_1_M014,Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,3
2596,Ses02F_script03_1_M015,"Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.",3
2597,Ses02F_script03_1_M016,Who knows.,3
2598,Ses02F_script03_1_M017,"No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.",3
2599,Ses02F_script03_1_M018,Depends on how well we've played.,3
2600,Ses02F_script03_1_M019,Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,1
2601,Ses02F_script03_1_M020,"No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",1
2602,Ses02F_script03_1_M021,So is everyone else in the long run.,3
2603,Ses02F_script03_1_M022,"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.",1
2604,Ses02F_script03_1_M023,"Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",1
2605,Ses02F_script03_1_M024,"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.",3
2606,Ses02F_script03_1_M025,You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,3
2607,Ses02F_script03_1_M026,The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,3
2608,Ses02F_script03_1_M027,"Ah, horrible thing.  I hated it.",-1
2609,Ses02F_script03_1_M028,How long did that row last?,3
2610,Ses02F_script03_1_M029,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,3
2611,Ses02F_script03_1_M030,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",-1
2612,Ses02F_script03_1_M031,I didn't hit you very hard.,3
2613,Ses02F_script03_1_M032,"Oh, I'll never forget his face.",1
2614,Ses02F_script03_1_M033,We were very much younger then.,3
2615,Ses02F_script03_1_M034,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",3
2616,Ses02F_script03_2_F000,"Honey, you knew there was nothing in that.",-1
2617,Ses02F_script03_2_F001,Presents?  Just a trivial little broach.,-1
2618,Ses02F_script03_2_F002,"No, it wasn't.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.",-1
2619,Ses02F_script03_2_F003,"No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",-1
2620,Ses02F_script03_2_F004,"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",-1
2621,Ses02F_script03_2_F005,"Well, what of it?",-1
2622,Ses02F_script03_2_F006,It didn't hurt him at all and I enjoyed it.,-1
2623,Ses02F_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",3
2624,Ses02F_script03_2_F008,I'm bored with this conversation.,-1
2625,Ses02F_script03_2_F009,"No, thanks.",-1
2626,Ses02F_script03_2_F010,Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.,-1
2627,Ses02F_script03_2_F011,Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,3
2628,Ses02F_script03_2_F012,"Well, it's become a habit with you.",3
2629,Ses02F_script03_2_F013,Don't be so stupid.,0
2630,Ses02F_script03_2_F014,What?,0
2631,Ses02F_script03_2_F015,"No, just making myself fascinating for you.",-1
2632,Ses02F_script03_2_F016,"A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?",1
2633,Ses02F_script03_2_F017,"No, it isn't.",-1
2634,Ses02F_script03_2_F018,"Oh, be quiet.",0
2635,Ses02F_script03_2_F019,Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,-1
2636,Ses02F_script03_2_F020,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",0
2637,Ses02F_script03_2_F021,They sting.,-1
2638,Ses02F_script03_2_F022,"I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.",-1
2639,Ses02F_script03_2_F023,"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",-1
2640,Ses02F_script03_2_F024,Mind your own business.,-1
2641,Ses02F_script03_2_F025,You're quite insufferable,0
2642,Ses02F_script03_2_F026,I expect it's because you're drunk.,-1
2643,Ses02F_script03_2_F027,You've always had a weak head.,-1
2644,Ses02F_script03_2_F028,"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",-1
2645,Ses02F_script03_2_F029,Shut up.,0
2646,Ses02F_script03_2_F030,"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",-1
2647,Ses02F_script03_2_F031,Why?,0
2648,Ses02F_script03_2_F032,There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,-1
2649,Ses02F_script03_2_F033,They're away in Tunis.,-1
2650,Ses02F_script03_2_F034,"Turn it on again, please.",0
2651,Ses02F_script03_2_F035,"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",0
2652,Ses02F_script03_2_F036,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,0
2653,Ses02F_script03_2_F037,Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.,0
2654,Ses02F_script03_2_F038,"Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",0
2655,Ses02F_script03_2_F039,"I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",0
2656,Ses02F_script03_2_F040,This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,0
2657,Ses02F_script03_2_F041,"Oh Yes, I am.",0
2658,Ses02F_script03_2_F042,I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,0
2659,Ses02F_script03_2_F043,Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,0
2660,Ses02F_script03_2_M000,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",3
2661,Ses02F_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,3
2662,Ses02F_script03_2_M002,"Ah, yes, I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.",-1
2663,Ses02F_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,-1
2664,Ses02F_script03_2_M004,"You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?",-1
2665,Ses02F_script03_2_M005,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,-1
2666,Ses02F_script03_2_M006,What of it?,0
2667,Ses02F_script03_2_M007,"Well, what about me?",0
2668,Ses02F_script03_2_M008,"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",-1
2669,Ses02F_script03_2_M009,"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",3
2670,Ses02F_script03_2_M010,I think I'll have some.,-1
2671,Ses02F_script03_2_M011,No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,3
2672,Ses02F_script03_2_M012,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,-1
2673,Ses02F_script03_2_M013,"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",0
2674,Ses02F_script03_2_M014,"Really, Amanda.",-1
2675,Ses02F_script03_2_M015,Nothing.,-1
2676,Ses02F_script03_2_M016,Going out somewhere dear?,-1
2677,Ses02F_script03_2_M017,That reply has broken my heart.,-1
2678,Ses02F_script03_2_M018,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",-1
2679,Ses02F_script03_2_M019,"Yes, it is.",-1
2680,Ses02F_script03_2_M020,"Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.",-1
2681,Ses02F_script03_2_M021,"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",-1
2682,Ses02F_script03_2_M022,Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,-1
2683,Ses02F_script03_2_M023,They snap.,-1
2684,Ses02F_script03_2_M024,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,-1
2685,Ses02F_script03_2_M025,"Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then.",-1
2686,Ses02F_script03_2_M026,"Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.",-1
2687,Ses02F_script03_2_M027,I'm not in the least drunk.,0
2688,Ses02F_script03_2_M028,"As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.",-1
2689,Ses02F_script03_2_M029,"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?",-1
2690,Ses02F_script03_2_M030,"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.",0
2691,Ses02F_script03_2_M031,All right.  I will.,-1
2692,Ses02F_script03_2_M032,"You better turn that off, I think.",-1
2693,Ses02F_script03_2_M033,Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.,-1
2694,Ses02F_script03_2_M034,There are people downstairs I suppose?,-1
2695,Ses02F_script03_2_M035,This is no time of the year for Tunis.,-1
2696,Ses02F_script03_2_M036,I'll do no such thing.,0
2697,Ses02F_script03_2_M037,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,0
2698,Ses02F_script03_2_M038,Turn it off.,0
2699,Ses02F_script03_2_M039,"Amanda, listen. listen",0
2700,Ses02F_script03_2_M040,"Very amusing, indeed.",-1

2724,Ses02M_impro01_F016,there is nothing I can do.,3

2729,Ses02M_impro01_F021,"Well, maybe you should",-1
2730,Ses02M_impro01_F022,Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.,-1
2731,Ses02M_impro01_F023,"I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.",-1

2804,Ses02M_impro03_F014,She must have flipped out.,1
2805,Ses02M_impro03_F015,Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER],1
2806,Ses02M_impro03_F016,Did you bring her up on stage too?,1
2807,Ses02M_impro03_F017,"Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.",1
2808,Ses02M_impro03_F018,Are your parents excited or...?,1
2809,Ses02M_impro03_F019,"Yea, totally. So when is it going to happen?",-1
2810,Ses02M_impro03_F020,"Ooh, that would be fun.",1
2811,Ses02M_impro03_F021,"Do you think you'll get a house or something, like you guys are looking to buy some place or",-1
2812,Ses02M_impro03_F022,Yeah. [LAUGHTER],-1
2813,Ses02M_impro03_F023,"Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.",1
2814,Ses02M_impro03_F024,"Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]",1
2815,Ses02M_impro03_F025,Did you have a good ring? You better have had a good ring.,-1
2816,Ses02M_impro03_F026,Good. The ring makes all the difference.,-1
2817,Ses02M_impro03_F027,"Oh, that's awesome.",-1
2818,Ses02M_impro03_F028,"Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.",1
2819,Ses02M_impro03_M000,"Oh, you're never going to believe it.",1
2820,Ses02M_impro03_M001,"Well, I finally did it",1
2821,Ses02M_impro03_M002,I-I asked her to marry me.,-1
2822,Ses02M_impro03_M003,"Yes, I know. [LAUGHTER]",-1
2823,Ses02M_impro03_M004,"I'm so nervous you know, I'm-",-1
2824,Ses02M_impro03_M005,"Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know",1
2825,Ses02M_impro03_M006,I know Uhm- I can't believe it.  It's like-,-1
2826,Ses02M_impro03_M007,"Well, yes, I wanted it you know I guess sort of as a surprise for everyone so",-1
2827,Ses02M_impro03_M008,"Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know",1
2828,Ses02M_impro03_M009,"I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.",1
2829,Ses02M_impro03_M010,"Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah",1
2830,Ses02M_impro03_M011,so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-,1
2831,Ses02M_impro03_M012,I-I did.,1
2832,Ses02M_impro03_M013,"So I got the band to do something, you know, like towards the end of the song I got to go up on stage and, uh",-1
2833,Ses02M_impro03_M014,"I know, so",1
2834,Ses02M_impro03_M015,I got to freak her out.,1
2835,Ses02M_impro03_M016,"No, yes -- so",1
2836,Ses02M_impro03_M017,"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",1
2837,Ses02M_impro03_M018,"No, but it was good.",1
2838,Ses02M_impro03_M019,"Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]",1
2839,Ses02M_impro03_M020,"I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.",1
2840,Ses02M_impro03_M021,"Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...",1
2841,Ses02M_impro03_M022,"Well, we're thinking uh - we're thinking winter time, you know, we're going to do it in the winter and then maybe, you know, maybe",-1
2842,Ses02M_impro03_M023,"I don't know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like Australia, Southern Hemisphere, [GARBAGE] so we'll decide with that.",-1
2843,Ses02M_impro03_M024,"Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first",1
2844,Ses02M_impro03_M025,but like you know it's just - I guess we're just excited right now that we'll get to continue it together.,-1
2845,Ses02M_impro03_M026,I know.,1
2846,Ses02M_impro03_M027,"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",1
2847,Ses02M_impro03_M028,"Sure. Oh, yes.",1
2848,Ses02M_impro03_M029,You know I had my mom come along maybe help me out a little bit because she's got good taste. but,-1
2849,Ses02M_impro03_M030,"Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah",1
2850,Ses02M_impro03_M031,Hah.,1
2851,Ses02M_impro04_F000,So how you feeling?,3
2852,Ses02M_impro04_F001,"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",3
2853,Ses02M_impro04_F002,"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",3
2854,Ses02M_impro04_F003,"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",3
2855,Ses02M_impro04_F004,"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",3
2856,Ses02M_impro04_F005,"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",3
2857,Ses02M_impro04_F006,"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",3
2858,Ses02M_impro04_F007,You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,3
2859,Ses02M_impro04_F008,"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",3
2860,Ses02M_impro04_F009,I'm sorry.,2
2861,Ses02M_impro04_F010,"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",3
2862,Ses02M_impro04_F011,"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",3
2863,Ses02M_impro04_F012,So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,3
2864,Ses02M_impro04_F013,"It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.",-1
2865,Ses02M_impro04_F014,"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",3
2866,Ses02M_impro04_F015,"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",3
2867,Ses02M_impro04_F016,"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",3
2868,Ses02M_impro04_F017,"Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.",-1
2869,Ses02M_impro04_M000,"Uhm, I don't know",-1
2870,Ses02M_impro04_M001,I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean,-1
2871,Ses02M_impro04_M002,"I have got to get a job, you know? Like-",-1
2872,Ses02M_impro04_M003,"Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-",-1
2873,Ses02M_impro04_M004,"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",-1
2874,Ses02M_impro04_M005,"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",-1
2875,Ses02M_impro04_M006,"I don't know, I mean why - why",-1
2876,Ses02M_impro04_M007,"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",-1
2877,Ses02M_impro04_M008,"Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",-1
2878,Ses02M_impro04_M009,"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",-1
2879,Ses02M_impro04_M010,"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",-1
2880,Ses02M_impro04_M011,"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",-1
2881,Ses02M_impro04_M012,"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",-1
2882,Ses02M_impro04_M013,I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,-1
2883,Ses02M_impro04_M014,"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",2
2884,Ses02M_impro04_M015,"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",-1
2885,Ses02M_impro04_M016,"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",-1
2886,Ses02M_impro04_M017,Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,-1
2887,Ses02M_impro04_M018,"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",-1
2888,Ses02M_impro04_M019,this doesn't happen to a normal person.,0
2889,Ses02M_impro04_M020,"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",-1
2890,Ses02M_impro04_M021,What am I going to do on a break?,-1
2891,Ses02M_impro04_M022,Right. Thanks for talking to me.,2
2892,Ses02M_impro05_F000,"Hi, can I help you?",3
2893,Ses02M_impro05_F001,"Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-",3
2894,Ses02M_impro05_F002,"Okay. Well, um- the f.",3
2895,Ses02M_impro05_F003,"Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-",3
2896,Ses02M_impro05_F004,"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",3
2897,Ses02M_impro05_F005,"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",3
2898,Ses02M_impro05_F006,Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,3
2899,Ses02M_impro05_F007,"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",3
2900,Ses02M_impro05_F008,"I- I- I understand, but um.",3
2901,Ses02M_impro05_F009,Okay,3
2902,Ses02M_impro05_F010,Right.,3
2903,Ses02M_impro05_F011,"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",3
2904,Ses02M_impro05_F012,"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",3
2905,Ses02M_impro05_F013,"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",3
2906,Ses02M_impro05_F014,So we'll- what we'll do,3
2907,Ses02M_impro05_F015,Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,3
2908,Ses02M_impro05_F016,"Um, so.",3
2909,Ses02M_impro05_F017,"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",3
2910,Ses02M_impro05_F018,I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.,3
2911,Ses02M_impro05_F019,"I understand, so-",3
2912,Ses02M_impro05_F020,"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",3
2913,Ses02M_impro05_F021,and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,3
2914,Ses02M_impro05_F022,"I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.",-1
2915,Ses02M_impro05_F023,"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",3
2916,Ses02M_impro05_F024,The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,3
2917,Ses02M_impro05_F025,Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,3
2918,Ses02M_impro05_F026,"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",3
2919,Ses02M_impro05_F027,I'm sorry. I don't- I-,-1
2920,Ses02M_impro05_F028,I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-,-1
2921,Ses02M_impro05_F029,There's other people waiting-,-1
2922,Ses02M_impro05_F030,Fine.,-1
2923,Ses02M_impro05_M000,Hi. Um-,3
2924,Ses02M_impro05_M001,It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,3
2925,Ses02M_impro05_M002,"Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.",3
2926,Ses02M_impro05_M003,Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know,3
2927,Ses02M_impro05_M004,"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",-1
2928,Ses02M_impro05_M005,What? What? How does that happen?,-1
2929,Ses02M_impro05_M006,I really - I really need that bag.,-1
2930,Ses02M_impro05_M007,there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got,-1
2931,Ses02M_impro05_M008,"I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",-1
2932,Ses02M_impro05_M009,It's worth a lot.,-1
2933,Ses02M_impro05_M010,"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",-1
2934,Ses02M_impro05_M011,can they check there?,-1
2935,Ses02M_impro05_M012,on another-,-1
2936,Ses02M_impro05_M013,"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",0
2937,Ses02M_impro05_M014,see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-,-1
2938,Ses02M_impro05_M015,Theft?,-1
2939,Ses02M_impro05_M016,"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",0
2940,Ses02M_impro05_M017,This is unbelievable. I've got,-1
2941,Ses02M_impro05_M018,you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay,0
2942,Ses02M_impro05_M019,"so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do",-1
2943,Ses02M_impro05_M020,"I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?",-1
2944,Ses02M_impro05_M021,You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage],-1
2945,Ses02M_impro05_M022,Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.,-1
2946,Ses02M_impro05_M023,"Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on",-1
2947,Ses02M_impro05_M024,"that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.",-1
2948,Ses02M_impro05_M025,The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,0
2949,Ses02M_impro05_M026,I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,0
2950,Ses02M_impro05_M027,because this is ridiculous?,-1
2951,Ses02M_impro05_M028,All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.,-1
2952,Ses02M_impro06_F000,What's going on?,-1
2953,Ses02M_impro06_F001,"Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry.",-1
2954,Ses02M_impro06_F002,"It doesn't make any easier, yes.",2
2955,Ses02M_impro06_F003,"Oh, man. I'm so sorry.",2
2956,Ses02M_impro06_F004,"It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.",2
2957,Ses02M_impro06_F005,Yeah.,2
2958,Ses02M_impro06_F006,Totally.,2
2959,Ses02M_impro06_F007,Yeah,2
2960,Ses02M_impro06_F008,"Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.",2
2961,Ses02M_impro06_F009,"She really cared about you, you know.",2
2962,Ses02M_impro06_F010,And she was,2
2963,Ses02M_impro06_F011,Yeah.,2
2964,Ses02M_impro06_F012,Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.,2
2965,Ses02M_impro06_F013,Are you going to be okay?,2
2966,Ses02M_impro06_F014,"It's going to be okay, I promise.",2
2967,Ses02M_impro06_F015,Sure,2
2968,Ses02M_impro06_F016,you shouldn't be alone,2
2969,Ses02M_impro06_F017,Yes.,2

2971,Ses02M_impro06_M000,Kathy died last night.,2
2972,Ses02M_impro06_M001,"yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -",2
2973,Ses02M_impro06_M002,"I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.",2
2974,Ses02M_impro06_M003,"I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,",2
2975,Ses02M_impro06_M004,"She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.",2
2976,Ses02M_impro06_M005,"Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but",2
2977,Ses02M_impro06_M006,"God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go",2
2978,Ses02M_impro06_M007,"out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.",2
2979,Ses02M_impro06_M008,"It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know",2
2980,Ses02M_impro06_M009,"not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.",2
2981,Ses02M_impro06_M010,She was [garbage],2
2982,Ses02M_impro06_M011,"Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great",2
2983,Ses02M_impro06_M012,so loving everybody you know.,2
2984,Ses02M_impro06_M013,"Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.",2
2985,Ses02M_impro06_M014,We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.,2
2986,Ses02M_impro06_M015,Yes.  [BREATHING] God.,2
2987,Ses02M_impro06_M016,"I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it",2
2988,Ses02M_impro06_M017,"just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.",2
2989,Ses02M_impro06_M018,Then she's gone.,2
2990,Ses02M_impro06_M019,"Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps",2
2991,Ses02M_impro06_M020,to talk to somebody but,2
2992,Ses02M_impro06_M021,"It's just going to take a while, I think.",2
2993,Ses02M_impro06_M022,Ah.,2
2994,Ses02M_impro06_M023,Thank you.,2

3140,Ses02M_script01_1_F019,I'm just saying,-1
3141,Ses02M_script01_1_F020,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,-1
3142,Ses02M_script01_1_F021,From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,3
3143,Ses02M_script01_1_F022,"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",-1
3144,Ses02M_script01_1_F023,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,3
3145,Ses02M_script01_1_F024,Have you asked Annie yet?,-1
3146,Ses02M_script01_1_F025,How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,3

3148,Ses02M_script01_1_F027,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,0
3149,Ses02M_script01_1_F028,That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,-1
3150,Ses02M_script01_1_F029,"I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.",-1
3151,Ses02M_script01_1_F030,"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",-1
3152,Ses02M_script01_1_F031,Just give it some more thought.,-1
3153,Ses02M_script01_1_F032,What the hell is this?,0
3154,Ses02M_script01_1_F033,"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",0
3155,Ses02M_script01_1_F034,What about the business? What is this?,0
3156,Ses02M_script01_1_F035,Must you be inspired?,0
3157,Ses02M_script01_1_F036,"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",0
3158,Ses02M_script01_1_F037,"Well, you don't want to think like that.",0
3159,Ses02M_script01_1_F038,"All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.",-1
3160,Ses02M_script01_1_F039,Just don't go thinking that way.,-1
3161,Ses02M_script01_1_F040,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
3162,Ses02M_script01_1_F041,"Yea, I can see that.",2
3163,Ses02M_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,-1
3164,Ses02M_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,-1
3165,Ses02M_script01_1_M002,About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.,-1
3166,Ses02M_script01_1_M003,I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,2
3167,Ses02M_script01_1_M004,No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,2
3168,Ses02M_script01_1_M005,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,2
3169,Ses02M_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,-1
3170,Ses02M_script01_1_M007,"I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.",-1
3171,Ses02M_script01_1_M008,Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,-1
3172,Ses02M_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,-1
3173,Ses02M_script01_1_M010,"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",-1
3174,Ses02M_script01_1_M011,"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",-1
3175,Ses02M_script01_1_M012,We've got to say it to him.,0
3176,Ses02M_script01_1_M013,"For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.",0
3177,Ses02M_script01_1_M014,Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.,-1
3178,Ses02M_script01_1_M015,All right. All right. Listen to me.,-1
3179,Ses02M_script01_1_M016,You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,3
3180,Ses02M_script01_1_M017,You know.,3
3181,Ses02M_script01_1_M018,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,3
3182,Ses02M_script01_1_M019,No it's not only my business.,-1
3183,Ses02M_script01_1_M020,So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?,-1
3184,Ses02M_script01_1_M021,See it isn't just my business-,0
3185,Ses02M_script01_1_M022,Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.,-1
3186,Ses02M_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl.,-1
3187,Ses02M_script01_1_M024,"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",0
3188,Ses02M_script01_1_M025,To hell with that.,0
3189,Ses02M_script01_1_M026,I wanted to get this settled first.,3
3190,Ses02M_script01_1_M027,"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",3

3252,Ses02M_script01_3_F006,"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",-1
3253,Ses02M_script01_3_F007,"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",1
3254,Ses02M_script01_3_F008,"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",3
3255,Ses02M_script01_3_F009,I guess this is why I came.,1
3256,Ses02M_script01_3_F010,"Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.",-1
3257,Ses02M_script01_3_F011,I almost got married two years ago.,-1
3258,Ses02M_script01_3_F012,"Well, you started to write me",1
3259,Ses02M_script01_3_F013,Every day since.,1
3260,Ses02M_script01_3_F014,"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?",-1
3261,Ses02M_script01_3_F015,"I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  I mean, all I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.",-1
3262,Ses02M_script01_3_F016,Not like that you're not.,-1
3263,Ses02M_script01_3_F017,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",-1
3264,Ses02M_script01_3_F018,"No.  What is it, Chris. Your mother?",-1
3265,Ses02M_script01_3_F019,"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",2
3266,Ses02M_script01_3_F020,You've gotta tell me.,-1
3267,Ses02M_script01_3_F021,It wouldn't work this way.,2
3268,Ses02M_script01_3_F022,"Yeah, sure.",-1
3269,Ses02M_script01_3_F023,How many?,-1
3270,Ses02M_script01_3_F024,gee.,-1
3271,Ses02M_script01_3_F025,Do you still feel that way?,2
3272,Ses02M_script01_3_F026,"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",2
3273,Ses02M_script01_3_F027,"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",2
3274,Ses02M_script01_3_F028,What'll I do with a fortune?,1
3275,Ses02M_script01_3_M000,"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",1
3276,Ses02M_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came?,-1
3277,Ses02M_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
3278,Ses02M_script01_3_M003,Oh.,-1
3279,Ses02M_script01_3_M004,What?,-1
3280,Ses02M_script01_3_M005,"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.",-1
3281,Ses02M_script01_3_M006,How'd you know?,-1
3282,Ses02M_script01_3_M007,"Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.",-1
3283,Ses02M_script01_3_M008,"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",-1
3284,Ses02M_script01_3_M009,I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,-1
3285,Ses02M_script01_3_M010,I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,1
3286,Ses02M_script01_3_M011,"You feel wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",-1
3287,Ses02M_script01_3_M012,And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,-1
3288,Ses02M_script01_3_M013,Why didn't you?,-1
3289,Ses02M_script01_3_M014,You felt something that far back?,1
3290,Ses02M_script01_3_M015,"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",1
3291,Ses02M_script01_3_M016,"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",-1
3292,Ses02M_script01_3_M017,"God, I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",-1
3293,Ses02M_script01_3_M018,"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",-1
3294,Ses02M_script01_3_M019,I kissed you.,-1
3295,Ses02M_script01_3_M020,Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,2
3296,Ses02M_script01_3_M021,No.  Nothing like that.,2
3297,Ses02M_script01_3_M022,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",2
3298,Ses02M_script01_3_M023,I don't know how to start.,-1
3299,Ses02M_script01_3_M024,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in charge of a company?",-1
3300,Ses02M_script01_3_M025,"Well, I lost them.",2
3301,Ses02M_script01_3_M026,Just about all.,2
3302,Ses02M_script01_3_M027,It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,2
3303,Ses02M_script01_3_M028,"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",2
3304,Ses02M_script01_3_M029,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",2
3305,Ses02M_script01_3_M030,"I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?",2
3306,Ses02M_script01_3_M031,"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",2
3307,Ses02M_script01_3_M032,"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",2
3308,Ses02M_script01_3_M033,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",2
3309,Ses02M_script01_3_M034,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",2
3310,Ses02M_script01_3_M035,Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,2
3311,Ses02M_script01_3_M036,I want you now Annie.,3
3312,Ses02M_script01_3_M037,I know Annie.  I'm gonna make a fortune for you.,-1
3313,Ses02M_script02_1_F000,Fine.,3
3314,Ses02M_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,3
3315,Ses02M_script02_1_F002,That's not your flashlight.,-1
3316,Ses02M_script02_1_F003,It's ours; it's mine too.,-1
3317,Ses02M_script02_1_F004,But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?,-1
3318,Ses02M_script02_1_F005,Yea.,3
3319,Ses02M_script02_1_F006,I'm cold.,3
3320,Ses02M_script02_1_F007,It's after eleven. Let's just go home.,-1
3321,Ses02M_script02_1_F008,There is no point in coming down here.,-1
3322,Ses02M_script02_1_F009,That's my point.,-1
3323,Ses02M_script02_1_F010,So let's go.,-1
3324,Ses02M_script02_1_F011,Not particularly.,3
3325,Ses02M_script02_1_F012,"I don't, it's just stupid.",-1
3326,Ses02M_script02_1_F013,"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",-1
3327,Ses02M_script02_1_F014,What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,-1
3328,Ses02M_script02_1_F015,Augie,-1
3329,Ses02M_script02_1_F016,I'm just not.,2
3330,Ses02M_script02_1_F017,Yes.,3
3331,Ses02M_script02_1_F018,"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",0
3332,Ses02M_script02_1_F019,We didn't see them the first time either.,-1
3333,Ses02M_script02_1_F020,That's the wind.,3
3334,Ses02M_script02_1_F021,About what?,3
3335,Ses02M_script02_1_F022,It's ridiculous.,-1
3336,Ses02M_script02_1_M000,What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.,1
3337,Ses02M_script02_1_M001,"God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.",1
3338,Ses02M_script02_1_M002,"I would have wanted to go a little further up the coast, get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid we'd miss it.",-1
3339,Ses02M_script02_1_M003,How you doing?,1
3340,Ses02M_script02_1_M004,"Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.",1
3341,Ses02M_script02_1_M005,"Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",1
3342,Ses02M_script02_1_M006,How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?,1
3343,Ses02M_script02_1_M007,"You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?",-1
3344,Ses02M_script02_1_M008,Who's is it?,-1
3345,Ses02M_script02_1_M009,"Oh well, sure, yes.",-1
3346,Ses02M_script02_1_M010,"No. No. Of course our flashlight yours and mine. Mi flashlight, es su flashlight, naturally.",-1
3347,Ses02M_script02_1_M011,How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,-1
3348,Ses02M_script02_1_M012,"I wonder do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year, do you remember?",-1
3349,Ses02M_script02_1_M013,"You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?",1
3350,Ses02M_script02_1_M014,"Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,",1
3351,Ses02M_script02_1_M015,"oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.",1
3352,Ses02M_script02_1_M016,You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,1
3353,Ses02M_script02_1_M017,What you want my jacket?,-1
3354,Ses02M_script02_1_M018,"Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?",-1
3355,Ses02M_script02_1_M019,Right.,-1
3356,Ses02M_script02_1_M020,That's my point too.,-1
3357,Ses02M_script02_1_M021,No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,-1
3358,Ses02M_script02_1_M022,Why not?,-1
3359,Ses02M_script02_1_M023,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",1
3360,Ses02M_script02_1_M024,"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",1
3361,Ses02M_script02_1_M025,"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",1
3362,Ses02M_script02_1_M026,"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",1
3363,Ses02M_script02_1_M027,Yes they do.,-1
3364,Ses02M_script02_1_M028,"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",1
3365,Ses02M_script02_1_M029,"you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.",1
3366,Ses02M_script02_1_M030,For real?,-1
3367,Ses02M_script02_1_M031,I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,-1
3368,Ses02M_script02_1_M032,"And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.",-1
3369,Ses02M_script02_1_M033,We weren't in a good spot.,-1
3370,Ses02M_script02_1_M034,We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,-1
3371,Ses02M_script02_1_M035,"There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?",1
3372,Ses02M_script02_1_M036,"This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.",1
3373,Ses02M_script02_1_M037,"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",1
3374,Ses02M_script02_1_M038,"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",1
3375,Ses02M_script02_1_M039,"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",1
3376,Ses02M_script02_1_M040,"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",1
3377,Ses02M_script02_1_M041,"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",1
3378,Ses02M_script02_1_M042,Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.,1
3379,Ses02M_script02_1_M043,"Well, so what do you think?",-1
3380,Ses02M_script02_1_M044,What I was saying.,-1
3381,Ses02M_script02_2_F000,About what?,-1
3382,Ses02M_script02_2_F001,It's ridiculous.,-1
3383,Ses02M_script02_2_F002,It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,-1
3384,Ses02M_script02_2_F003,"Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",-1
3385,Ses02M_script02_2_F004,I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,-1
3386,Ses02M_script02_2_F005,Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,0
3387,Ses02M_script02_2_F006,We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,0
3388,Ses02M_script02_2_F007,For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,-1
3389,Ses02M_script02_2_F008,"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",-1
3390,Ses02M_script02_2_F009,"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",-1
3391,Ses02M_script02_2_F010,"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",-1
3392,Ses02M_script02_2_F011,I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,0
3393,Ses02M_script02_2_F012,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,-1
3394,Ses02M_script02_2_F013,"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",0
3395,Ses02M_script02_2_F014,For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,-1
3396,Ses02M_script02_2_F015,Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,2
3397,Ses02M_script02_2_F016,"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",2
3398,Ses02M_script02_2_F017,And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,2
3399,Ses02M_script02_2_F018,"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",2
3400,Ses02M_script02_2_F019,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",2
3401,Ses02M_script02_2_F020,I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,2
3402,Ses02M_script02_2_F021,No.,2
3403,Ses02M_script02_2_F022,No.,2
3404,Ses02M_script02_2_F023,No.,-1
3405,Ses02M_script02_2_F024,No.,-1
3406,Ses02M_script02_2_F025,No.,-1
3407,Ses02M_script02_2_F026,No.,-1
3408,Ses02M_script02_2_F027,No.,-1
3409,Ses02M_script02_2_F028,I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,-1
3410,Ses02M_script02_2_F029,"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",-1
3411,Ses02M_script02_2_F030,"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",-1
3412,Ses02M_script02_2_F031,"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",2
3413,Ses02M_script02_2_F032,I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,-1
3414,Ses02M_script02_2_F033,I know that Augie. Really I do.,-1
3415,Ses02M_script02_2_F034,"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",2
3416,Ses02M_script02_2_F035,I didn't say that.,-1
3417,Ses02M_script02_2_F036,"For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",-1
3418,Ses02M_script02_2_F037,Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,1
3419,Ses02M_script02_2_F038,"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",2
3420,Ses02M_script02_2_F039,"Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",-1
3421,Ses02M_script02_2_F040,"Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.",-1
3422,Ses02M_script02_2_F041,"Augie, you brought refreshments.",-1
3423,Ses02M_script02_2_F042,"Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",1
3424,Ses02M_script02_2_F043,No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.,-1
3425,Ses02M_script02_2_F044,"Augie, I'm sorry.",2
3426,Ses02M_script02_2_F045,Or not.,1
3427,Ses02M_script02_2_F046,Hmm.,3
3428,Ses02M_script02_2_M000,So what do you think?,3
3429,Ses02M_script02_2_M001,What I was saying.,3
3430,Ses02M_script02_2_M002,Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,3
3431,Ses02M_script02_2_M003,"Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.",-1
3432,Ses02M_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
3433,Ses02M_script02_2_M005,"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",-1
3434,Ses02M_script02_2_M006,"Well, what's bugging you?",-1
3435,Ses02M_script02_2_M007,"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",-1
3436,Ses02M_script02_2_M008,Why not?,-1
3437,Ses02M_script02_2_M009,We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,-1
3438,Ses02M_script02_2_M010,"Well, we'll see them this year.",3
3439,Ses02M_script02_2_M011,I thought you wanted to see them.,-1
3440,Ses02M_script02_2_M012,No of course not.,-1
3441,Ses02M_script02_2_M013,"It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.",-1
3442,Ses02M_script02_2_M014,All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,-1
3443,Ses02M_script02_2_M015,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",3
3444,Ses02M_script02_2_M016,"""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",3
3445,Ses02M_script02_2_M017,"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",3
3446,Ses02M_script02_2_M018,Wait a minute I've got it,-1
3447,Ses02M_script02_2_M019,"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",1
3448,Ses02M_script02_2_M020,"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",1
3449,Ses02M_script02_2_M021,"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",3
3450,Ses02M_script02_2_M022,You want to go get some champagne?,3
3451,Ses02M_script02_2_M023,Take off our shoes?,3
3452,Ses02M_script02_2_M024,"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",-1
3453,Ses02M_script02_2_M025,Get married again?,3
3454,Ses02M_script02_2_M026,What? What? You want a divorce?,-1
3455,Ses02M_script02_2_M027,A vacation?,-1
3456,Ses02M_script02_2_M028,"A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?",-1
3457,Ses02M_script02_2_M029,"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",0
3458,Ses02M_script02_2_M030,"You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?",-1
3459,Ses02M_script02_2_M031,"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",-1
3460,Ses02M_script02_2_M032,"'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",-1
3461,Ses02M_script02_2_M033,"Yes, it is.",-1
3462,Ses02M_script02_2_M034,Right.,-1
3463,Ses02M_script02_2_M035,"No, I know. Me neither.",2
3464,Ses02M_script02_2_M036,I'm doing the best I can.,-1
3465,Ses02M_script02_2_M037,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,2
3466,Ses02M_script02_2_M038,"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",2
3467,Ses02M_script02_2_M039,Yeah?,-1
3468,Ses02M_script02_2_M040,"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",1
3469,Ses02M_script02_2_M041,I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,1
3470,Ses02M_script02_2_M042,What have we got here?,1
3471,Ses02M_script02_2_M043,It's not champagne.,-1
3472,Ses02M_script02_2_M044,You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?,-1
3473,Ses02M_script02_2_M045,"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",1
3474,Ses02M_script02_2_M046,Or not.,1
3475,Ses02M_script03_1_F000,Do you think it's them?,-1
3476,Ses02M_script03_1_F001,"Well, nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",-1
3477,Ses02M_script03_1_F002,What are we going to do?,1
3478,Ses02M_script03_1_F003,Now and always sweet.,1
3479,Ses02M_script03_1_F004,It's bound to come sooner or later.,-1
3480,Ses02M_script03_1_F005,Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.,1
3481,Ses02M_script03_1_F006,Behave exquisitely.,1
3482,Ses02M_script03_1_F007,"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",1
3483,Ses02M_script03_1_F008,What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,-1
3484,Ses02M_script03_1_F009,It's true; the whole business is a very poor joke.,-1
3485,Ses02M_script03_1_F010,Yes. Meaning just that.,-1
3486,Ses02M_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,-1
3487,Ses02M_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,1
3488,Ses02M_script03_1_F013,"Well, if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.",-1
3489,Ses02M_script03_1_F014,"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",-1
3490,Ses02M_script03_1_F015,"Oh dear, should we like that?",2
3491,Ses02M_script03_1_F016,"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",-1
3492,Ses02M_script03_1_F017,"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",-1
3493,Ses02M_script03_1_F018,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",-1
3494,Ses02M_script03_1_F019,"Elliot, worms don't pop.",-1
3495,Ses02M_script03_1_F020,"Thank you dear, the same applies you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",-1
3496,Ses02M_script03_1_F021,Which particular one?,1
3497,Ses02M_script03_1_F022,"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",1
3498,Ses02M_script03_1_F023,I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,1
3499,Ses02M_script03_1_F024,It went on intermittently for days.,1
3500,Ses02M_script03_1_F025,It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,1
3501,Ses02M_script03_1_F026,That was the first time you ever hit me.,-1
3502,Ses02M_script03_1_F027,The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,1
3503,Ses02M_script03_1_F028,"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",1
3504,Ses02M_script03_1_F029,And very much sillier.,1
3505,Ses02M_script03_1_M000,Good God.,-1
3506,Ses02M_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,-1
3507,Ses02M_script03_1_M002,Must be them then.,-1
3508,Ses02M_script03_1_M003,"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",-1
3509,Ses02M_script03_1_M004,I don't care then.,-1
3510,Ses02M_script03_1_M005,Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,1
3511,Ses02M_script03_1_M006,What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,-1
3512,Ses02M_script03_1_M007,With the most perfect poise.,1
3513,Ses02M_script03_1_M008,"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",1
3514,Ses02M_script03_1_M009,Oh darling don't say that.,2
3515,Ses02M_script03_1_M010,Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,1
3516,Ses02M_script03_1_M011,What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?,1
3517,Ses02M_script03_1_M012,"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",1
3518,Ses02M_script03_1_M013,"All those futile moralists, who try to make life unbearable, laugh at them, be flippant. Laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths",-1
3519,Ses02M_script03_1_M014,flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.,1
3520,Ses02M_script03_1_M015,"Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.",1
3521,Ses02M_script03_1_M016,"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",2
3522,Ses02M_script03_1_M017,Depends on how well we play it.,-1
3523,Ses02M_script03_1_M018,"Yes, yes, with all his might.",1
3524,Ses02M_script03_1_M019,"No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",1
3525,Ses02M_script03_1_M020,So is everyone else in the long run.,1
3526,Ses02M_script03_1_M021,"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.",1
3527,Ses02M_script03_1_M022,Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,1
3528,Ses02M_script03_1_M023,"I don't care what you do see. You can paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome, and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word, as long as you love me best.",-1
3529,Ses02M_script03_1_M024,You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,1
3530,Ses02M_script03_1_M025,"The one when you bought that little, painted, wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.",-1
3531,Ses02M_script03_1_M026,"Horrible thing, I hated it.",-1
3532,Ses02M_script03_1_M027,How long did that row last?,-1
3533,Ses02M_script03_1_M028,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown.,-1
3534,Ses02M_script03_1_M029,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",1
3535,Ses02M_script03_1_M030,I didn't hit you very hard.,-1
3536,Ses02M_script03_1_M031,I'll never forget his face.,1
3537,Ses02M_script03_1_M032,We were very much younger then.,-1
3538,Ses02M_script03_1_M033,As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,-1
3539,Ses02M_script03_2_F000,You knew there was nothing in that.,1
3540,Ses02M_script03_2_F001,"Presents, just a trivial little broach.",1
3541,Ses02M_script03_2_F002,No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,3
3542,Ses02M_script03_2_F003,"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",3
3543,Ses02M_script03_2_F004,"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",-1
3544,Ses02M_script03_2_F005,What of it?,3
3545,Ses02M_script03_2_F006,"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",3
3546,Ses02M_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",3
3547,Ses02M_script03_2_F008,I'm bored of this conversation.,-1
3548,Ses02M_script03_2_F009,No thanks.,3
3549,Ses02M_script03_2_F010,I don't see why you want any you've already had two glasses.,-1
3550,Ses02M_script03_2_F011,It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,3
3551,Ses02M_script03_2_F012,"Well, it's become a habit with you.",3
3552,Ses02M_script03_2_F013,Don't be so stupid.,-1
3553,Ses02M_script03_2_F014,What?,0
3554,Ses02M_script03_2_F015,No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,3
3555,Ses02M_script03_2_F016,It's a woman's job to allure the man,-1
3556,Ses02M_script03_2_F017,"watch me a minute, will you?",-1
3557,Ses02M_script03_2_F018,"Oh, no it isn't.",-1
3558,Ses02M_script03_2_F019,Be quiet.,0
3559,Ses02M_script03_2_F020,It doesn't seem to work such wonders with you.,-1
3560,Ses02M_script03_2_F021,Adders don't snap they sting.,-1
3561,Ses02M_script03_2_F022,They sting.,-1
3562,Ses02M_script03_2_F023,I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,0
3563,Ses02M_script03_2_F024,"Yes, I did quite a lot.",3
3564,Ses02M_script03_2_F025,Mind your own business.,-1
3565,Ses02M_script03_2_F026,You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,-1
3566,Ses02M_script03_2_F027,On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of Brandy.,-1
3567,Ses02M_script03_2_F028,Oh be quiet.,0
3568,Ses02M_script03_2_F029,"Not very funny my dear, you better have some more Brandy.",-1
3569,Ses02M_script03_2_F030,Why?,-1
3570,Ses02M_script03_2_F031,There aren't any people upstairs it's a photographer's studio.,-1
3571,Ses02M_script03_2_F032,They're away in Tunis.,-1
3572,Ses02M_script03_2_F033,"Turn it on again, please.",-1
3573,Ses02M_script03_2_F034,"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",-1
3574,Ses02M_script03_2_F035,You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,0
3575,Ses02M_script03_2_F036,Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,0
3576,Ses02M_script03_2_F037,"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",0
3577,Ses02M_script03_2_F038,"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",0
3578,Ses02M_script03_2_F039,"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",0
3579,Ses02M_script03_2_F040,Oh yes I am.,0
3580,Ses02M_script03_2_F041,"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",0

4015,Ses03F_impro08_M002,"trying to get an answer, and no one's given me an answer.  So what are you going to do about it?",-1
4016,Ses03F_impro08_M003,"Fuck, do you think I have all day?  Jesus",-1
4017,Ses03F_impro08_M004,"Fine, sorry.  Okay, my phone's been on the fritz for like three days.  I can't get any incoming calls. What- What is going on?",-1

4025,Ses03F_impro08_M012,A free calling card?,0
4026,Ses03F_impro08_M013,"No, I don't have a land line.",-1
4027,Ses03F_impro08_M014,"That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?",0
4028,Ses03F_impro08_M015,"Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?",0
4029,Ses03F_impro08_M016,So you take things from me and you expect me just to wait around.,-1

4036,Ses03F_impro08_M023,-to make up the three million dollars.,-1

4038,Ses03F_impro08_M025,So you're giving me a dollar back.,-1
4039,Ses03F_impro08_M026,"Oh, my God.",-1
4040,Ses03F_script01_1_F000,What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.,-1
4041,Ses03F_script01_1_F001,"What-how did he see it? I mean, I was the first one up. He was still in bed.",-1
4042,Ses03F_script01_1_F002,When?,-1
4043,Ses03F_script01_1_F003,What was he doing out at four in the morning?,-1
4044,Ses03F_script01_1_F004,Did you talk to him?,3
4045,Ses03F_script01_1_F005,"He cried hard, huh?",3
4046,Ses03F_script01_1_F006,What was he doing out there at that time? He was dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night again.,-1
4047,Ses03F_script01_1_F007,"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",3
4048,Ses03F_script01_1_F008,What's the meaning in that?,-1
4049,Ses03F_script01_1_F009,"Well, what do you mean? What?",-1
4050,Ses03F_script01_1_F010,"What do you mean, dishonest?",3
4051,Ses03F_script01_1_F011,"What, you're going to argue with him?",-1
4052,Ses03F_script01_1_F012,You can't tell him that.,-1
4053,Ses03F_script01_1_F013,We can't. It just won't work.,-1
4054,Ses03F_script01_1_F014,They do come back.,3
4055,Ses03F_script01_1_F015,"I know, but he doesn't know that.",-1
4056,Ses03F_script01_1_F016,Three years has been a long time.,-1
4057,Ses03F_script01_1_F017,"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",0
4058,Ses03F_script01_1_F018,What?,-1
4059,Ses03F_script01_1_F019,Why?,3
4060,Ses03F_script01_1_F020,"Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?",-1
4061,Ses03F_script01_1_F021,"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",3
4062,Ses03F_script01_1_F022,"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",-1
4063,Ses03F_script01_1_F023,"Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.",-1
4064,Ses03F_script01_1_F024,"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",-1
4065,Ses03F_script01_1_F025,And she-she's Larry's girl.,-1
4066,Ses03F_script01_1_F026,"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",-1
4067,Ses03F_script01_1_F027,"If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.",-1
4068,Ses03F_script01_1_F028,"'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",-1
4069,Ses03F_script01_1_F029,What do you want from me?,-1
4070,Ses03F_script01_1_F030,You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,3
4071,Ses03F_script01_1_F031,There's nothing wrong with it.,3
4072,Ses03F_script01_1_F032,You didn't ask her yet?,-1
4073,Ses03F_script01_1_F033,"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?",-1
4074,Ses03F_script01_1_F034,"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",-1
4075,Ses03F_script01_1_F035,I don't understand why it has to be her.,-1
4076,Ses03F_script01_1_F036,"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",-1
4077,Ses03F_script01_1_F037,"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",-1
4078,Ses03F_script01_1_F038,"No, I don't want a diagram.",-1
4079,Ses03F_script01_1_F039,"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",-1
4080,Ses03F_script01_1_F040,"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",-1
4081,Ses03F_script01_1_F041,What the hell is this?,-1
4082,Ses03F_script01_1_F042,You're crazy.,-1
4083,Ses03F_script01_1_F043,You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,-1
4084,Ses03F_script01_1_F044,"Oh, you have to be inspired.",-1
4085,Ses03F_script01_1_F045,Tell me something.,3
4086,Ses03F_script01_1_F046,You'd leave that business.,3
4087,Ses03F_script01_1_F047,You can't do that.,-1
4088,Ses03F_script01_1_F048,"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",-1
4089,Ses03F_script01_1_F049,"We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.",-1
4090,Ses03F_script01_1_F050,I'm going to.,3
4091,Ses03F_script01_1_F051,You just can't talk like that.,-1
4092,Ses03F_script01_1_F052,"I don't know you, do I?",3
4093,Ses03F_script01_1_F053,Yeah. I can see that.,3
4094,Ses03F_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,3
4095,Ses03F_script01_1_M001,He was out there when it happened.,3
4096,Ses03F_script01_1_M002,"Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.",3
4097,Ses03F_script01_1_M003,I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,3
4098,Ses03F_script01_1_M004,"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",3
4099,Ses03F_script01_1_M005,I could hear it right through the floor.,3
4100,Ses03F_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,3
4101,Ses03F_script01_1_M007,I don't know.,3
4102,Ses03F_script01_1_M008,"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",3
4103,Ses03F_script01_1_M009,Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,3
4104,Ses03F_script01_1_M010,You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,-1
4105,Ses03F_script01_1_M011,"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",-1
4106,Ses03F_script01_1_M012,We got to tell him that.,-1
4107,Ses03F_script01_1_M013,"You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.",-1
4108,Ses03F_script01_1_M014,"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",-1
4109,Ses03F_script01_1_M015,"All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.",-1
4110,Ses03F_script01_1_M016,"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",3
4111,Ses03F_script01_1_M017,You know.,3
4112,Ses03F_script01_1_M018,I want to ask her to marry me.,3
4113,Ses03F_script01_1_M019,"Come on, you know that's not only my business.",-1
4114,Ses03F_script01_1_M020,So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,3
4115,Ses03F_script01_1_M021,"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",0
4116,Ses03F_script01_1_M022,"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",0
4117,Ses03F_script01_1_M023,God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.,-1
4118,Ses03F_script01_1_M024,"No, she is not Larry's girl.",-1
4119,Ses03F_script01_1_M025,"Oh, I don't know.",-1
4120,Ses03F_script01_1_M026,"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",2
4121,Ses03F_script01_1_M027,To hell with that.,0
4122,Ses03F_script01_1_M028,I didn't ask Annie yet.,3
4123,Ses03F_script01_1_M029,I wanted to get this settled first.,3
4124,Ses03F_script01_1_M030,Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,3
4125,Ses03F_script01_1_M031,"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",3
4126,Ses03F_script01_1_M032,"Mom, don't avoid me.",-1
4127,Ses03F_script01_1_M033,So what? I'm not fast with women.,-1
4128,Ses03F_script01_1_M034,Because it is.,3
4129,Ses03F_script01_1_M035,I just-,-1
4130,Ses03F_script01_1_M036,It just is. I-,3
4131,Ses03F_script01_1_M037,"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",-1
4132,Ses03F_script01_1_M038,"Okay. All right, then.",-1
4133,Ses03F_script01_1_M039,"No, I've given it three years of thought.",-1
4134,Ses03F_script01_1_M040,And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,-1
4135,Ses03F_script01_1_M041,But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,3
4136,Ses03F_script01_1_M042,I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,3
4137,Ses03F_script01_1_M043,I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.,-1
4138,Ses03F_script01_1_M044,The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,-1
4139,Ses03F_script01_1_M045,Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,0
4140,Ses03F_script01_1_M046,"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",0
4141,Ses03F_script01_1_M047,"Now, where do I find it?",3
4142,Ses03F_script01_1_M048,Yes. On this I would.,3
4143,Ses03F_script01_1_M049,Then help me stay here.,3
4144,Ses03F_script01_1_M050,Okay. Just-,3
4145,Ses03F_script01_1_M051,"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",-1
4146,Ses03F_script01_1_M052,I am thinking like that.,3
4147,Ses03F_script01_1_M053,"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",3
4148,Ses03F_script01_2_F000,Why did you invite her here?,0
4149,Ses03F_script01_2_F001,She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,0
4150,Ses03F_script01_2_F002,You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,0
4151,Ses03F_script01_2_F003,He's not going to marry her.,-1
4152,Ses03F_script01_2_F004,It's got that about it.,0
4153,Ses03F_script01_2_F005,"What's going on here, Joe?",-1
4154,Ses03F_script01_2_F006,She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,0
4155,Ses03F_script01_2_F007,Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,-1
4156,Ses03F_script01_2_F008,"I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.",-1
4157,Ses03F_script01_2_F009,She's waited.,-1
4158,Ses03F_script01_2_F010,"Because she thinks like me, that's why.",-1
4159,Ses03F_script01_2_F011,"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",2
4160,Ses03F_script01_2_F012,"I think again, that I'm-I'm right.",-1
4161,Ses03F_script01_2_F013,"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",0
4162,Ses03F_script01_2_F014,Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.,-1
4163,Ses03F_script01_2_F015,"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",0
4164,Ses03F_script01_2_F016,"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",0
4165,Ses03F_script01_2_F017,"You got to believe, believe with me because I can't stand all alone.",-1
4166,Ses03F_script01_2_F018,"No, you've got to believe.",2
4167,Ses03F_script01_2_F019,"Believe, Joe. You above all people have got to believe.",-1
4168,Ses03F_script01_2_F020,You got to keep believing.,2
4169,Ses03F_script01_2_F021,I can't help it.,2
4170,Ses03F_script01_2_M000,Why? Does that bother you?,-1
4171,Ses03F_script01_2_M001,"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",3
4172,Ses03F_script01_2_M002,"What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.",-1
4173,Ses03F_script01_2_M003,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,3
4174,Ses03F_script01_2_M004,"Well, so what?",3
4175,Ses03F_script01_2_M005,"Listen, kid-",-1
4176,Ses03F_script01_2_M006,You can't read her mind.,3
4177,Ses03F_script01_2_M007,How do you know why she's waited?,3
4178,Ses03F_script01_2_M008,"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",3
4179,Ses03F_script01_2_M009,Calm yourself.,3
4180,Ses03F_script01_2_M010,Calm yourself.,-1
4181,Ses03F_script01_2_M011,All right. All right. Calm yourself.,0
4182,Ses03F_script01_2_M012,Okay. Just calm yourself.,-1
4183,Ses03F_script01_2_M013,"Why me, above all?",0
4184,Ses03F_script01_2_M014,Huh?,0
4185,Ses03F_script01_2_M015,Why me above all?,0
4186,Ses03F_script01_2_M016,"Look at you, you're shaking.",0
4187,Ses03F_script01_2_M017,What have I got to hide?,0
4188,Ses03F_script01_2_M018,"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",0
4189,Ses03F_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,1
4190,Ses03F_script01_3_F001,"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",1
4191,Ses03F_script01_3_F002,It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,1
4192,Ses03F_script01_3_F003,No. I'm not sorry. It's-,2
4193,Ses03F_script01_3_F004,I can't stay.,-1
4194,Ses03F_script01_3_F005,"Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].",-1
4195,Ses03F_script01_3_F006,"Look,",-1
4196,Ses03F_script01_3_F007,"you've been acting kind of, well, you know.",-1
4197,Ses03F_script01_3_F008,"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",2
4198,Ses03F_script01_3_F009,Yeah.,-1
4199,Ses03F_script01_3_F010,"Yeah, they would. Especially your mom.",-1
4200,Ses03F_script01_3_F011,"Well, I mean,",1
4201,Ses03F_script01_3_F012,"from her opinion, why else would I come here?",1
4202,Ses03F_script01_3_F013,"Well, I guess that's why I came.",1
4203,Ses03F_script01_3_F014,"I've been ready for a long, long time.",1
4204,Ses03F_script01_3_F015,Look,-1
4205,Ses03F_script01_3_F016,I was almost married two years ago.,-1
4206,Ses03F_script01_3_F017,'Cause you started to write me.,-1
4207,Ses03F_script01_3_F018,Every day since.,1
4208,Ses03F_script01_3_F019,"Well, I don't know, you didn't write until then and then when you did, what'd you say?",-1
4209,Ses03F_script01_3_F020,You always can be so ambiguous.,-1
4210,Ses03F_script01_3_F021,I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,1
4211,Ses03F_script01_3_F022,"Not like that, you're not.",-1
4212,Ses03F_script01_3_F023,"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",1
4213,Ses03F_script01_3_F024,What is it?,-1
4214,Ses03F_script01_3_F025,No. What is it? Is it your mother?,2
4215,Ses03F_script01_3_F026,"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",2
4216,Ses03F_script01_3_F027,You should tell me.,2
4217,Ses03F_script01_3_F028,"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",2
4218,Ses03F_script01_3_F029,"Yeah, sure.",2
4219,Ses03F_script01_3_F030,How many?,2
4220,Ses03F_script01_3_F031,Geez.,2
4221,Ses03F_script01_3_F032,And you still feel that way?,2
4222,Ses03F_script01_3_F033,"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",2
4223,Ses03F_script01_3_F034,"I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.",-1
4224,Ses03F_script01_3_F035,What am I going to do with a fortune?,1
4225,Ses03F_script01_3_M000,"Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?",1
4226,Ses03F_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came?,3
4227,Ses03F_script01_3_M002,Why not?,-1
4228,Ses03F_script01_3_M003,Well-,3
4229,Ses03F_script01_3_M004,What?,3
4230,Ses03F_script01_3_M005,"Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.",-1
4231,Ses03F_script01_3_M006,"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",1
4232,Ses03F_script01_3_M007,How did you know?,-1
4233,Ses03F_script01_3_M008,"Well, uh- would you want to?",-1
4234,Ses03F_script01_3_M009,"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",1
4235,Ses03F_script01_3_M010,"Oh, Annie.",1
4236,Ses03F_script01_3_M011,"Annie, I love you.",1
4237,Ses03F_script01_3_M012,I love you a great deal.,1
4238,Ses03F_script01_3_M013,I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,1
4239,Ses03F_script01_3_M014,"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",1
4240,Ses03F_script01_3_M015,I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,1
4241,Ses03F_script01_3_M016,Then he's gone forever. You're sure?,-1
4242,Ses03F_script01_3_M017,Why didn't you?,-1
4243,Ses03F_script01_3_M018,You felt something that far back?,1
4244,Ses03F_script01_3_M019,Why didn't you let me know?,1
4245,Ses03F_script01_3_M020,"Give me a kiss, Annie.",1
4246,Ses03F_script01_3_M021,Give me-,1
4247,Ses03F_script01_3_M022,"[LAUGHTER]. God, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",-1
4248,Ses03F_script01_3_M023,We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,1
4249,Ses03F_script01_3_M024,I kissed you.,1
4250,Ses03F_script01_3_M025,Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,2
4251,Ses03F_script01_3_M026,"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",3
4252,Ses03F_script01_3_M027,"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",2
4253,Ses03F_script01_3_M028,I don't know where to start.,2
4254,Ses03F_script01_3_M029,You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,2
4255,Ses03F_script01_3_M030,"Well, I lost them.",2
4256,Ses03F_script01_3_M031,Just about all.,2
4257,Ses03F_script01_3_M032,It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,2
4258,Ses03F_script01_3_M033,"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",2
4259,Ses03F_script01_3_M034,"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",2
4260,Ses03F_script01_3_M035,"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",2
4261,Ses03F_script01_3_M036,"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",2
4262,Ses03F_script01_3_M037,And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,2
4263,Ses03F_script01_3_M038,And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,2
4264,Ses03F_script01_3_M039,And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,2
4265,Ses03F_script01_3_M040,"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",2
4266,Ses03F_script01_3_M041,"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",2
4267,Ses03F_script01_3_M042,And I didn't want to take any of it.,2
4268,Ses03F_script01_3_M043,And I guess that included you.,2
4269,Ses03F_script01_3_M044,"I want you now, Annie.",-1
4270,Ses03F_script01_3_M045,"Annie,",1
4271,Ses03F_script01_3_M046,"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",1
4272,Ses03F_script02_1_F000,Fine.,2
4273,Ses03F_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,-1
4274,Ses03F_script02_1_F002,That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.,-1
4275,Ses03F_script02_1_F003,"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",0
4276,Ses03F_script02_1_F004,Yes.,-1
4277,Ses03F_script02_1_F005,I'm cold.,-1
4278,Ses03F_script02_1_F006,"It's past eleven, let's go home.",-1
4279,Ses03F_script02_1_F007,There is no point in coming down here.,-1
4280,Ses03F_script02_1_F008,That's my point.,-1
4281,Ses03F_script02_1_F009,"Well, so let's go.",-1
4282,Ses03F_script02_1_F010,Not particularly.,2
4283,Ses03F_script02_1_F011,I don't know. I just don't.,2
4284,Ses03F_script02_1_F012,Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,0
4285,Ses03F_script02_1_F013,"I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",-1
4286,Ses03F_script02_1_F014,"Oh, God, Augie.",-1
4287,Ses03F_script02_1_F015,"I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.",-1
4288,Ses03F_script02_1_F016,Yes.,-1
4289,Ses03F_script02_1_F017,"Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.",-1
4290,Ses03F_script02_1_F018,"No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.",-1
4291,Ses03F_script02_1_F019,"Yeah, that's the wind.",-1
4292,Ses03F_script02_1_F020,About what?,-1
4293,Ses03F_script02_1_F021,It's ridiculous.,-1
4294,Ses03F_script02_1_M000,"Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?",1
4295,Ses03F_script02_1_M001,Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.,1
4296,Ses03F_script02_1_M002,"You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?",1
4297,Ses03F_script02_1_M003,"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",1
4298,Ses03F_script02_1_M004,"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",1
4299,Ses03F_script02_1_M005,"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",1
4300,Ses03F_script02_1_M006,"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",1
4301,Ses03F_script02_1_M007,"Oh, well, sure.",-1
4302,Ses03F_script02_1_M008,"No, of course. Yours and mine. Our flashlight. Yours and mine. Mi flashlight is su flashlight. Naturally.",-1
4303,Ses03F_script02_1_M009,We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,1
4304,Ses03F_script02_1_M010,I hope the moon stays out.,1
4305,Ses03F_script02_1_M011,"Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",1
4306,Ses03F_script02_1_M012,Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,-1
4307,Ses03F_script02_1_M013,"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",1
4308,Ses03F_script02_1_M014,"You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",1
4309,Ses03F_script02_1_M015,I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,1
4310,Ses03F_script02_1_M016,I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,1
4311,Ses03F_script02_1_M017,Do you want my jacket?,3
4312,Ses03F_script02_1_M018,What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,-1
4313,Ses03F_script02_1_M019,Right.,3
4314,Ses03F_script02_1_M020,"Yeah, that's my point too.",3
4315,Ses03F_script02_1_M021,"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",1
4316,Ses03F_script02_1_M022,"I mean, don't you want to see it?",3
4317,Ses03F_script02_1_M023,Why not?,3
4318,Ses03F_script02_1_M024,"Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.",-1
4319,Ses03F_script02_1_M025,Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.,-1
4320,Ses03F_script02_1_M026,"I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.",-1
4321,Ses03F_script02_1_M027,"Yeah, they do.",-1
4322,Ses03F_script02_1_M028,"What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.",-1
4323,Ses03F_script02_1_M029,"There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.",-1
4324,Ses03F_script02_1_M030,For real?,-1
4325,Ses03F_script02_1_M031,I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.,-1
4326,Ses03F_script02_1_M032,And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.,-1
4327,Ses03F_script02_1_M033,We weren't in a good spot.,-1
4328,Ses03F_script02_1_M034,"We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-",-1
4329,Ses03F_script02_1_M035,"no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?",-1
4330,Ses03F_script02_1_M036,"I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",1
4331,Ses03F_script02_1_M037,Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.,-1
4332,Ses03F_script02_1_M038,"And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",1
4333,Ses03F_script02_1_M039,"You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.",1
4334,Ses03F_script02_1_M040,"its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.",1
4335,Ses03F_script02_1_M041,"They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here",1
4336,Ses03F_script02_1_M042,"where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.",1
4337,Ses03F_script02_1_M043,So what do you think?,-1
4338,Ses03F_script02_1_M044,About what I just said.,3
4339,Ses03F_script02_2_F000,About what?,3
4340,Ses03F_script02_2_F001,It's ridiculous.,-1
4341,Ses03F_script02_2_F002,"It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.",-1
4342,Ses03F_script02_2_F003,Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.,-1
4343,Ses03F_script02_2_F004,I don't care. It's still fish to me.,-1
4344,Ses03F_script02_2_F005,"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",0
4345,Ses03F_script02_2_F006,"Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.",-1
4346,Ses03F_script02_2_F007,It's not like that.,-1
4347,Ses03F_script02_2_F008,"Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.",-1
4348,Ses03F_script02_2_F009,Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.,-1
4349,Ses03F_script02_2_F010,"No, we won't.",-1
4350,Ses03F_script02_2_F011,"It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?",-1
4351,Ses03F_script02_2_F012,Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,0
4352,Ses03F_script02_2_F013,I do.,-1
4353,Ses03F_script02_2_F014,"Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.",-1
4354,Ses03F_script02_2_F015,"For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.",-1
4355,Ses03F_script02_2_F016,Do you remember the last time we came here?,2
4356,Ses03F_script02_2_F017,We thought I was pregnant.,2
4357,Ses03F_script02_2_F018,You brought a bottle of champagne.,2
4358,Ses03F_script02_2_F019,We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,1
4359,Ses03F_script02_2_F020,And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,1
4360,Ses03F_script02_2_F021,"Oh, that moment-that was it.",1
4361,Ses03F_script02_2_F022,"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",2
4362,Ses03F_script02_2_F023,Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,1
4363,Ses03F_script02_2_F024,I don't want to remember something.,2
4364,Ses03F_script02_2_F025,Hope for some things.,2
4365,Ses03F_script02_2_F026,No.,2
4366,Ses03F_script02_2_F027,No.,2
4367,Ses03F_script02_2_F028,"No, no.",2
4368,Ses03F_script02_2_F029,No.,-1
4369,Ses03F_script02_2_F030,No.,-1
4370,Ses03F_script02_2_F031,No.,0
4371,Ses03F_script02_2_F032,No.,-1
4372,Ses03F_script02_2_F033,I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,-1
4373,Ses03F_script02_2_F034,This what? What is this? This is nothing.,-1
4374,Ses03F_script02_2_F035,"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",0
4375,Ses03F_script02_2_F036,Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,2
4376,Ses03F_script02_2_F037,"I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but",-1
4377,Ses03F_script02_2_F038,it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,2
4378,Ses03F_script02_2_F039,"I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.",2
4379,Ses03F_script02_2_F040,I didn't say that.,2
4380,Ses03F_script02_2_F041,"Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.",-1
4381,Ses03F_script02_2_F042,"God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.",-1
4382,Ses03F_script02_2_F043,"Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.",1
4383,Ses03F_script02_2_F044,I noticed that. It's beautiful.,1
4384,Ses03F_script02_2_F045,You can see right over the water.,1
4385,Ses03F_script02_2_F046,"God, big old white moon.",-1
4386,Ses03F_script02_2_F047,You brought refreshments?,-1
4387,Ses03F_script02_2_F048,At least we won't need glasses.,1
4388,Ses03F_script02_2_F049,So I was thinking you might be right.,-1
4389,Ses03F_script02_2_F050,Maybe this is the right place after all.,1
4390,Ses03F_script02_2_F051,"I'm sorry, Augie.",2
4391,Ses03F_script02_2_F052,Or not.,-1
4392,Ses03F_script02_2_M000,So what do you think?,-1
4393,Ses03F_script02_2_M001,About what I was just saying.,3
4394,Ses03F_script02_2_M002,It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,-1
4395,Ses03F_script02_2_M003,"Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.",-1
4396,Ses03F_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
4397,Ses03F_script02_2_M005,"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",3
4398,Ses03F_script02_2_M006,"Okay, then what's bugging you?",-1
4399,Ses03F_script02_2_M007,"There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.",-1
4400,Ses03F_script02_2_M008,We're not seeing the grunions?,3
4401,Ses03F_script02_2_M009,We missed them twice. That's not ever.,-1
4402,Ses03F_script02_2_M010,We'll see them this time.,-1
4403,Ses03F_script02_2_M011,"God, I thought you wanted to see it.",-1
4404,Ses03F_script02_2_M012,It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.,-1
4405,Ses03F_script02_2_M013,"I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.",-1
4406,Ses03F_script02_2_M014,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.",-1
4407,Ses03F_script02_2_M015,"And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-",-1
4408,Ses03F_script02_2_M016,Wait a minute. I got it.,3
4409,Ses03F_script02_2_M017,"It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",-1
4410,Ses03F_script02_2_M018,"You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",-1
4411,Ses03F_script02_2_M019,"Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?",-1
4412,Ses03F_script02_2_M020,Do you want me to get some champagne?,-1
4413,Ses03F_script02_2_M021,Take off our shoes?,-1
4414,Ses03F_script02_2_M022,What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,-1
4415,Ses03F_script02_2_M023,Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?,-1
4416,Ses03F_script02_2_M024,A vacation?,-1
4417,Ses03F_script02_2_M025,A new carpet? A poodle?,-1
4418,Ses03F_script02_2_M026,"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",0
4419,Ses03F_script02_2_M027,"Jesus, welcome to the human race.",-1
4420,Ses03F_script02_2_M028,Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?,-1
4421,Ses03F_script02_2_M029,"No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.",-1
4422,Ses03F_script02_2_M030,"You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",-1
4423,Ses03F_script02_2_M031,"Yes, it is.",-1
4424,Ses03F_script02_2_M032,Right.,-1
4425,Ses03F_script02_2_M033,"No, I know. Me neither.",-1
4426,Ses03F_script02_2_M034,"Well, I'm doing the best I can.",-1
4427,Ses03F_script02_2_M035,"Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.",-1
4428,Ses03F_script02_2_M036,"No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.",-1
4429,Ses03F_script02_2_M037,Yeah?,-1
4430,Ses03F_script02_2_M038,"Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.",1
4431,Ses03F_script02_2_M039,"Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.",1
4432,Ses03F_script02_2_M040,Look what we got here.,1
4433,Ses03F_script02_2_M041,It's not champagne.,1
4434,Ses03F_script02_2_M042,Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?,3
4435,Ses03F_script02_2_M043,Shh.,3
4436,Ses03F_script02_2_M044,If we're very quiet the fish might come.,1
4437,Ses03F_script02_2_M045,Or not.,1
4438,Ses03F_script03_1_F000,[BREATHING],3
4439,Ses03F_script03_1_F001,Do you think it's them?,3
4440,Ses03F_script03_1_F002,"I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",-1
4441,Ses03F_script03_1_F003,What are we to do?,-1
4442,Ses03F_script03_1_F004,"Yes. Now and always, sweet.",-1
4443,Ses03F_script03_1_F005,It was bound to come sooner or later.,-1
4444,Ses03F_script03_1_F006,"[LAUGHTER] God, it sent shivers up my spine.",-1
4445,Ses03F_script03_1_F007,"Um terrible thing is one can't stay happy. Well, it's true. I mean, the whole business is a very poor joke.",-1
4446,Ses03F_script03_1_F008,"Yes, meaning just that.",-1
4447,Ses03F_script03_1_F009,Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,1
4448,Ses03F_script03_1_F010,Who's they?,-1
4449,Ses03F_script03_1_F011,"Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.",-1
4450,Ses03F_script03_1_F012,"So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",-1
4451,Ses03F_script03_1_F013,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,-1
4452,Ses03F_script03_1_F014,"Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",2
4453,Ses03F_script03_1_F015,"Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",2
4454,Ses03F_script03_1_F016,"Well, that's serious enough.",-1
4455,Ses03F_script03_1_F017,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",-1
4456,Ses03F_script03_1_F018,"Elliott, worms don't pop.",-1
4457,Ses03F_script03_1_F019,"Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.",1
4458,Ses03F_script03_1_F020,Which particular one?,-1
4459,Ses03F_script03_1_F021,Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.,1
4460,Ses03F_script03_1_F022,I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,-1
4461,Ses03F_script03_1_F023,It went on intermittently for days.,-1
4462,Ses03F_script03_1_F024,"Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].",-1
4463,Ses03F_script03_1_F025,yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.,1
4464,Ses03F_script03_1_F026,The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER],1
4465,Ses03F_script03_1_F027,I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.,1
4466,Ses03F_script03_1_F028,"Yeah, and very much sillier.",-1
4467,Ses03F_script03_1_M000,Oh.,-1
4468,Ses03F_script03_1_M001,Good God.,-1
4469,Ses03F_script03_1_M002,I wonder.,-1
4470,Ses03F_script03_1_M003,It must be them then.,-1
4471,Ses03F_script03_1_M004,"We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.",3
4472,Ses03F_script03_1_M005,Then I don't care.,3
4473,Ses03F_script03_1_M006,"Hello? Hello? What? Ugh, wrong number.",-1
4474,Ses03F_script03_1_M007,"things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",1
4475,Ses03F_script03_1_M008,"Ooh darling, don't say that.",-1
4476,Ses03F_script03_1_M009,"You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",-1
4477,Ses03F_script03_1_M010,What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?,-1
4478,Ses03F_script03_1_M011,"[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.",1
4479,Ses03F_script03_1_M012,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,-1
4480,Ses03F_script03_1_M013,"Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.",1
4481,Ses03F_script03_1_M014,Who knows?,-1
4482,Ses03F_script03_1_M015,No. The fire will fade along with our passion.,-1
4483,Ses03F_script03_1_M016,Depends on how well we play it.,-1
4484,Ses03F_script03_1_M017,"Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.",-1
4485,Ses03F_script03_1_M018,"No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.",-1
4486,Ses03F_script03_1_M019,So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,-1
4487,Ses03F_script03_1_M020,"Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",1
4488,Ses03F_script03_1_M021,"I don't care what you do, see? As long-you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",-1
4489,Ses03F_script03_1_M022,Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,1
4490,Ses03F_script03_1_M023,The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,-1
4491,Ses03F_script03_1_M024,Horrible little thing. I hated it.,-1
4492,Ses03F_script03_1_M025,How long did that row last?,-1
4493,Ses03F_script03_1_M026,The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,-1
4494,Ses03F_script03_1_M027,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",1
4495,Ses03F_script03_1_M028,I didn't hit you very hard.,-1
4496,Ses03F_script03_1_M029,"Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].",-1
4497,Ses03F_script03_1_M030,We were very much younger then.,-1
4498,Ses03F_script03_1_M031,"Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",-1
4499,Ses03F_script03_2_F000,You knew there was nothing in that.,-1
4500,Ses03F_script03_2_F001,Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.,-1
4501,Ses03F_script03_2_F002,Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.,-1
4502,Ses03F_script03_2_F003,"No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.",-1
4503,Ses03F_script03_2_F004,"Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.",3
4504,Ses03F_script03_2_F005,"Well, what of it?",-1
4505,Ses03F_script03_2_F006,"Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.",-1
4506,Ses03F_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.",-1
4507,Ses03F_script03_2_F008,"Well, it's true.",3
4508,Ses03F_script03_2_F009,"I definitely, most definitely am.",-1
4509,Ses03F_script03_2_F010,"No, thanks.",-1
4510,Ses03F_script03_2_F011,I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,-1
4511,Ses03F_script03_2_F012,I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.,-1
4512,Ses03F_script03_2_F013,It's become a habit with you.,3
4513,Ses03F_script03_2_F014,Don't be so stupid.,0
4514,Ses03F_script03_2_F015,What?,0
4515,Ses03F_script03_2_F016,No. Just making myself fascinating for you.,-1
4516,Ses03F_script03_2_F017,"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",3
4517,Ses03F_script03_2_F018,"No, it isn't.",0
4518,Ses03F_script03_2_F019,"No, it's not. I don't care.",-1
4519,Ses03F_script03_2_F020,"Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?",-1
4520,Ses03F_script03_2_F021,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",-1
4521,Ses03F_script03_2_F022,They sting.,-1
4522,Ses03F_script03_2_F023,"I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",0
4523,Ses03F_script03_2_F024,"Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.",-1
4524,Ses03F_script03_2_F025,Mind your business.,-1
4525,Ses03F_script03_2_F026,You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,0
4526,Ses03F_script03_2_F027,You've always had a weak head.,-1
4527,Ses03F_script03_2_F028,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",-1
4528,Ses03F_script03_2_F029,Do shut up. Shut up.,-1
4529,Ses03F_script03_2_F030,I don't want to talk about this anymore.,-1
4530,Ses03F_script03_2_F031,Why?,-1
4531,Ses03F_script03_2_F032,There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,-1
4532,Ses03F_script03_2_F033,They're away in Tunis.,-1
4533,Ses03F_script03_2_F034,"Turn it on again, please.",-1
4534,Ses03F_script03_2_F035,Turn it on.,0
4535,Ses03F_script03_2_F036,You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.,-1
4536,Ses03F_script03_2_F037,I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,0
4537,Ses03F_script03_2_F038,"Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",0
4538,Ses03F_script03_2_F039,"Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",0
4539,Ses03F_script03_2_F040,This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,0
4540,Ses03F_script03_2_F041,"Oh, yes I am.",0
4541,Ses03F_script03_2_F042,"Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",0
4542,Ses03F_script03_2_F043,"Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.",0
4543,Ses03F_script03_2_M000,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",0
4544,Ses03F_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,0
4545,Ses03F_script03_2_M002,I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,0
4546,Ses03F_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,-1
4547,Ses03F_script03_2_M004,You must admit that he was in love with you.,-1
4548,Ses03F_script03_2_M005,You let him kiss you. You said so.,0
4549,Ses03F_script03_2_M006,What of it?,-1
4550,Ses03F_script03_2_M007,What about me?,0
4551,Ses03F_script03_2_M008,"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",0
4552,Ses03F_script03_2_M009,Are you bored with this conversation?,3
4553,Ses03F_script03_2_M010,So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?,3
4554,Ses03F_script03_2_M011,"I'll have a little, I think.",3
4555,Ses03F_script03_2_M012,"No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.",3
4556,Ses03F_script03_2_M013,"Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.",-1
4557,Ses03F_script03_2_M014,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,0
4558,Ses03F_script03_2_M015,"Really, Amanda.",0
4559,Ses03F_script03_2_M016,Nothing.,0
4560,Ses03F_script03_2_M017,"Going somewhere, dear?",0
4561,Ses03F_script03_2_M018,That reply has broken my heart.,-1
4562,Ses03F_script03_2_M019,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",-1
4563,Ses03F_script03_2_M020,"Yes, it is.",0
4564,Ses03F_script03_2_M021,It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,-1
4565,Ses03F_script03_2_M022,"Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",-1
4566,Ses03F_script03_2_M023,"Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",-1
4567,Ses03F_script03_2_M024,They snap.,0
4568,Ses03F_script03_2_M025,"Uhh,",-1
4569,Ses03F_script03_2_M026,did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,0
4570,Ses03F_script03_2_M027,"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",0
4571,Ses03F_script03_2_M028,You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,0
4572,Ses03F_script03_2_M029,I'm not in the least bit drunk.,0
4573,Ses03F_script03_2_M030,"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",0
4574,Ses03F_script03_2_M031,"Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.",-1
4575,Ses03F_script03_2_M032,You better turn that off.,-1
4576,Ses03F_script03_2_M033,It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,-1
4577,Ses03F_script03_2_M034,"Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.",0
4578,Ses03F_script03_2_M035,This is no time of the year for Tunis.,3
4579,Ses03F_script03_2_M036,"No, I will do no such thing.",-1
4580,Ses03F_script03_2_M037,No.,-1
4581,Ses03F_script03_2_M038,Turn it off.,0
4582,Ses03F_script03_2_M039,"Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",0
4583,Ses03F_script03_2_M040,Very amusing indeed.,0
4584,Ses03F_script03_2_M041,"You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.",0
4585,Ses03F_script03_2_M042,"No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.",0
4586,Ses03F_script03_2_M043,"Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",0
4587,Ses03F_script03_2_M044,"I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",0
4588,Ses03M_impro01_F000,Is that a demand sir?,3
4589,Ses03M_impro01_F001,I must see it before I just take it.,-1
4590,Ses03M_impro01_F002,"Sir, you completely filled this out wrong.",-1
4591,Ses03M_impro01_F003,No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.,3
4592,Ses03M_impro01_F004,"No, no, no, no, no.  You're going to have to go back over on the other side-- --second door, up the stairs...",-1
4593,Ses03M_impro01_F005,No I can't just transfer it myself sir.  You got to do this.  Everyone else is doing the same thing.,-1
4594,Ses03M_impro01_F006,Excuse me sir?,-1
4595,Ses03M_impro01_F007,I think you're being a little condescending.,-1
4596,Ses03M_impro01_F008,You need to go back over there and fill it out again.,-1
4597,Ses03M_impro01_F009,"No, no, no, because there are other people in line.  You have to go get a complete new application.",-1
4598,Ses03M_impro01_F010,"No, no, no. Sir,you need to get out of the line--",-1
4599,Ses03M_impro01_F011,"Well I'm going to have to call- security because sir, you- there are hundreds of people waiting in line at this D.M.V.-- --We're closing in about half an hour...",-1
4600,Ses03M_impro01_F012,"You will get your license, sir, you have to go fill out-- --another copy...excuse me?",-1
4601,Ses03M_impro01_F013,No.  Now I'm going to take this from you because you are obviously misleading,-1
4602,Ses03M_impro01_F014,No.  You couldn't go get another one.,-1

5227,Ses03M_script01_1_F005,He cried hard?,2
5228,Ses03M_script01_1_F006,"God, what was he doing out there anyway?",-1
5229,Ses03M_script01_1_F007,Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.,-1
5230,Ses03M_script01_1_F008,"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",2
5231,Ses03M_script01_1_F009,What?,-1
5232,Ses03M_script01_1_F010,What do you mean dishonest?,-1
5233,Ses03M_script01_1_F011,What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?,-1
5234,Ses03M_script01_1_F012,You can't say that to him.,-1
5235,Ses03M_script01_1_F013,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,-1
5236,Ses03M_script01_1_F014,"To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,",-1
5237,Ses03M_script01_1_F015,he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?,-1
5238,Ses03M_script01_1_F016,No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,0
5239,Ses03M_script01_1_F017,Why?,0
5240,Ses03M_script01_1_F018,Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?,-1
5241,Ses03M_script01_1_F019,Well that's your business Chris.,-1
5242,Ses03M_script01_1_F020,"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",0
5243,Ses03M_script01_1_F021,"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",3
5244,Ses03M_script01_1_F022,Well I'm just saying--,-1
5245,Ses03M_script01_1_F023,You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,-1
5246,Ses03M_script01_1_F024,She's not...she's Larry's girl.,-1
5247,Ses03M_script01_1_F025,From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,-1
5248,Ses03M_script01_1_F026,"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",-1
5249,Ses03M_script01_1_F027,You're a considerate fellow.  There is nothing wrong in that.,-1
5250,Ses03M_script01_1_F028,Did you ask Annie yet?,3
5251,Ses03M_script01_1_F029,And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?,-1
5252,Ses03M_script01_1_F030,"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",3
5253,Ses03M_script01_1_F031,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,-1
5254,Ses03M_script01_1_F032,"Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",-1
5255,Ses03M_script01_1_F033,No I don't want a diagram.,-1
5256,Ses03M_script01_1_F034,"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",-1
5257,Ses03M_script01_1_F035,"Look, just give it some thought okay?",-1
5258,Ses03M_script01_1_F036,What the hell is this?,-1
5259,Ses03M_script01_1_F037,Are you crazy?,-1
5260,Ses03M_script01_1_F038,You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,0
5261,Ses03M_script01_1_F039,"Oh, you have to be inspired.",-1
5262,Ses03M_script01_1_F040,Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,2
5263,Ses03M_script01_1_F041,You can't talk like that.,-1
5264,Ses03M_script01_1_F042,Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?,-1
5265,Ses03M_script01_1_F043,"I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.",0
5266,Ses03M_script01_1_F044,Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.,-1
5267,Ses03M_script01_1_F045,I don't understand you do I?,2
5268,Ses03M_script01_1_F046,Yeah.  I can see that.,2
5269,Ses03M_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,2
5270,Ses03M_script01_1_M001,He was out there when it happened.,2
5271,Ses03M_script01_1_M002,About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,2
5272,Ses03M_script01_1_M003,I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.,2
5273,Ses03M_script01_1_M004,No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,2
5274,Ses03M_script01_1_M005,I could hear it right through the floor.,2
5275,Ses03M_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,2
5276,Ses03M_script01_1_M007,"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",2
5277,Ses03M_script01_1_M008,Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,-1
5278,Ses03M_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,0
5279,Ses03M_script01_1_M010,"No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.",-1
5280,Ses03M_script01_1_M011,"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",0
5281,Ses03M_script01_1_M012,That we haven't had any hope for years now?,0
5282,Ses03M_script01_1_M013,We got to say it to him.,-1
5283,Ses03M_script01_1_M014,Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,-1
5284,Ses03M_script01_1_M015,"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",-1
5285,Ses03M_script01_1_M016,Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,-1
5286,Ses03M_script01_1_M017,"You know why I asked Annie here, right?",3
5287,Ses03M_script01_1_M018,You know.,-1
5288,Ses03M_script01_1_M019,I want to ask her to marry me.,3
5289,Ses03M_script01_1_M020,You know it's not just my business.,-1
5290,Ses03M_script01_1_M021,Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,3
5291,Ses03M_script01_1_M022,Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,0
5292,Ses03M_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl.,-1
5293,Ses03M_script01_1_M024,I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,-1
5294,Ses03M_script01_1_M025,Because other people will suffer.,-1
5295,Ses03M_script01_1_M026,"My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.",-1
5296,Ses03M_script01_1_M027,Well to hell with that.,0
5297,Ses03M_script01_1_M028,I wanted to get this settled first.,3
5298,Ses03M_script01_1_M029,Then I guess that's the end of it.,3
5299,Ses03M_script01_1_M030,But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,2
5300,Ses03M_script01_1_M031,"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",3
5301,Ses03M_script01_1_M032,Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.,-1
5302,Ses03M_script01_1_M033,Because it is.,-1
5303,Ses03M_script01_1_M034,It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,-1
5304,Ses03M_script01_1_M035,Alright then.,-1
5305,Ses03M_script01_1_M036,I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,2
5306,Ses03M_script01_1_M037,But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,3
5307,Ses03M_script01_1_M038,I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,3
5308,Ses03M_script01_1_M039,I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,0
5309,Ses03M_script01_1_M040,The business doesn't inspire me.,0
5310,Ses03M_script01_1_M041,Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,0
5311,Ses03M_script01_1_M042,Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?,-1
5312,Ses03M_script01_1_M043,Yes.  On this I would.,3
5313,Ses03M_script01_1_M044,Then help me stay here.,-1
5314,Ses03M_script01_1_M045,I know.  Just you help me stay here.,2
5315,Ses03M_script01_1_M046,I am thinking like that.,2
5316,Ses03M_script01_1_M047,No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,2
5317,Ses03M_script01_2_F000,Why did he invite her here?,0
5318,Ses03M_script01_2_F001,Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,0
5319,Ses03M_script01_2_F002,Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.,-1
5320,Ses03M_script01_2_F003,He's not going to marry her.,-1
5321,Ses03M_script01_2_F004,I see it.  It has the appearance of it.,-1
5322,Ses03M_script01_2_F005,What's going on here Joe?,-1
5323,Ses03M_script01_2_F006,No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,0
5324,Ses03M_script01_2_F007,"Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but, she's waiting.",-1
5325,Ses03M_script01_2_F008,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.",-1
5326,Ses03M_script01_2_F009,"I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.",0
5327,Ses03M_script01_2_F010,"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",2
5328,Ses03M_script01_2_F011,it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,2
5329,Ses03M_script01_2_F012,"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",0
5330,Ses03M_script01_2_F013,I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.,-1
5331,Ses03M_script01_2_F014,But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.,-1
5332,Ses03M_script01_2_F015,"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",0
5333,Ses03M_script01_2_F016,I can't do it all alone.,-1
5334,Ses03M_script01_2_F017,"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",2
5335,Ses03M_script01_2_F018,"Look, just keep believing okay?",-1
5336,Ses03M_script01_2_F019,I can't help it.,2
5337,Ses03M_script01_2_M000,Why does that bother you?,-1
5338,Ses03M_script01_2_M001,"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",3
5339,Ses03M_script01_2_M002,uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,-1
5340,Ses03M_script01_2_M003,Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,-1
5341,Ses03M_script01_2_M004,Who said he even thought about that?,3
5342,Ses03M_script01_2_M005,"Well, so what?",3
5343,Ses03M_script01_2_M006,Now listen kid...,-1
5344,Ses03M_script01_2_M007,You can't read her mind.,-1
5345,Ses03M_script01_2_M008,How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?,3
5346,Ses03M_script01_2_M009,Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?,-1
5347,Ses03M_script01_2_M010,What do you want me to do?  What do you want?,-1
5348,Ses03M_script01_2_M011,But Kate...,-1
5349,Ses03M_script01_2_M012,Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.,-1
5350,Ses03M_script01_2_M013,"Calm yourself, alright?",-1
5351,Ses03M_script01_2_M014,"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",0
5352,Ses03M_script01_2_M015,"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",0
5353,Ses03M_script01_2_M016,"Look at you, you're shaking.",0
5354,Ses03M_script01_2_M017,What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,0
5355,Ses03M_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,-1
5356,Ses03M_script01_3_F001,"No.  It's alright.  It's a good thing, you know?",-1
5357,Ses03M_script01_3_F002,It's lovely here.,-1
5358,Ses03M_script01_3_F003,The air is so sweet.,-1
5359,Ses03M_script01_3_F004,No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,2
5360,Ses03M_script01_3_F005,First of all your mother so much as told me to go.,-1
5361,Ses03M_script01_3_F006,"Look,",2
5362,Ses03M_script01_3_F007,"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",2
5363,Ses03M_script01_3_F008,"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",2
5364,Ses03M_script01_3_F009,"Yeah.  I know they would, especially your mother.",-1
5365,Ses03M_script01_3_F010,"Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?",-1
5366,Ses03M_script01_3_F011,"Well,",1
5367,Ses03M_script01_3_F012,I guess that's why I came.,1
5368,Ses03M_script01_3_F013,"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",1
5369,Ses03M_script01_3_F014,"Look, I almost got married two years ago.",1
5370,Ses03M_script01_3_F015,You started to write me.,1
5371,Ses03M_script01_3_F016,Every day since.,1
5372,Ses03M_script01_3_F017,"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",1
5373,Ses03M_script01_3_F018,You'd always be so ambiguous.,1
5374,Ses03M_script01_3_F019,I'll never forgive you for that.,1
5375,Ses03M_script01_3_F020,"I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",1
5376,Ses03M_script01_3_F021,Not like that you're not.,1
5377,Ses03M_script01_3_F022,Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.,-1
5378,Ses03M_script01_3_F023,What is it?,-1
5379,Ses03M_script01_3_F024,"No, what is it?  Your mother?",-1
5380,Ses03M_script01_3_F025,"Tell me what's wrong.  I mean, even in your letters you seemed ashamed.",-1
5381,Ses03M_script01_3_F026,You got to tell me.,-1
5382,Ses03M_script01_3_F027,Okay.  It wouldn't work like this?,-1
5383,Ses03M_script01_3_F028,"Yeah, sure.",-1
5384,Ses03M_script01_3_F029,How many?,2
5385,Ses03M_script01_3_F030,Geez.,2
5386,Ses03M_script01_3_F031,And you still feel that way?,2
5387,Ses03M_script01_3_F032,Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.,-1
5388,Ses03M_script01_3_F033,"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",2
5389,Ses03M_script01_3_F034,What am I going to do with a fortune?,1
5390,Ses03M_script01_3_M000,I know.  It sort of went out of style didn't it?,-1
5391,Ses03M_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came?,3
5392,Ses03M_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
5393,Ses03M_script01_3_M003,Well...,-1
5394,Ses03M_script01_3_M004,What?,3
5395,Ses03M_script01_3_M005,Well the trouble is I was planning on sneaking up on you over a week or so and they take it for granted that we're all set.,-1
5396,Ses03M_script01_3_M006,How did you know?,-1
5397,Ses03M_script01_3_M007,"So, would you want to?",-1
5398,Ses03M_script01_3_M008,"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",1
5399,Ses03M_script01_3_M009,Oh Annie.  I love you.  I love you a great deal.,-1
5400,Ses03M_script01_3_M010,I love you.,1
5401,Ses03M_script01_3_M011,I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.,-1
5402,Ses03M_script01_3_M012,I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?,-1
5403,Ses03M_script01_3_M013,"This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me.",-1
5404,Ses03M_script01_3_M014,"Then he's gone forever, you sure?",-1
5405,Ses03M_script01_3_M015,Why didn't you?,-1
5406,Ses03M_script01_3_M016,You felt something that far back.,1
5407,Ses03M_script01_3_M017,Why didn't you let me know?,-1
5408,Ses03M_script01_3_M018,"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",1
5409,Ses03M_script01_3_M019,"Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.",1
5410,Ses03M_script01_3_M020,"How long, how long I've been waiting to do that.",-1
5411,Ses03M_script01_3_M021,We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,1
5412,Ses03M_script01_3_M022,I kissed you.,-1
5413,Ses03M_script01_3_M023,"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",2
5414,Ses03M_script01_3_M024,"No, nothing, nothing like that.",-1
5415,Ses03M_script01_3_M025,"Well, yes I guess I've been ashamed but, it's going from me.",-1
5416,Ses03M_script01_3_M026,I don't know where to start.,-1
5417,Ses03M_script01_3_M027,You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,2
5418,Ses03M_script01_3_M028,Well I lost them.,2
5419,Ses03M_script01_3_M029,Just about all.,2
5420,Ses03M_script01_3_M030,Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,2

5611,Ses03M_script03_1_F009,"It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.",-1
5612,Ses03M_script03_1_F010,Yes.  I mean just that.,-1
5613,Ses03M_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,-1
5614,Ses03M_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,-1
5615,Ses03M_script03_1_F013,So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.,-1
5616,Ses03M_script03_1_F014,How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?,-1
5617,Ses03M_script03_1_F015,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,-1
5618,Ses03M_script03_1_F016,"Well, dear, shall we want that?",-1
5619,Ses03M_script03_1_F017,"What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",-1
5620,Ses03M_script03_1_F018,That's serious enough.,2
5621,Ses03M_script03_1_F019,Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.,-1
5622,Ses03M_script03_1_F020,"Elliot, worms don't pop.",-1
5623,Ses03M_script03_1_F021,Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...,-1
5624,Ses03M_script03_1_F022,...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.,-1
5625,Ses03M_script03_1_F023,Which particular one?,-1
5626,Ses03M_script03_1_F024,"Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.",-1
5627,Ses03M_script03_1_F025,Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,-1
5628,Ses03M_script03_1_F026,It went on intermittently for days.,-1
5629,Ses03M_script03_1_F027,I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,-1
5630,Ses03M_script03_1_F028,[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.,-1
5631,Ses03M_script03_1_F029,"The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.",-1
5632,Ses03M_script03_1_F030,"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",-1
5633,Ses03M_script03_1_F031,And much sillier too.,-1
5634,Ses03M_script03_1_M000,Good God.,-1
5635,Ses03M_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,-1
5636,Ses03M_script03_1_M002,Well it must be them then.,-1
5637,Ses03M_script03_1_M003,We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.,-1
5638,Ses03M_script03_1_M004,I don't care then.,1
5639,Ses03M_script03_1_M005,Hello?  Hello?  What?,-1
5640,Ses03M_script03_1_M006,"No, wrong number.",1
5641,Ses03M_script03_1_M007,What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?,-1
5642,Ses03M_script03_1_M008,With the most perfect poise?,-1
5643,Ses03M_script03_1_M009,um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?,-1
5644,Ses03M_script03_1_M010,"Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",-1
5645,Ses03M_script03_1_M011,"You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?",-1
5646,Ses03M_script03_1_M012,What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?,-1
5647,Ses03M_script03_1_M013,"[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.",-1
5648,Ses03M_script03_1_M014,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.,-1
5649,Ses03M_script03_1_M015,Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,-1
5650,Ses03M_script03_1_M016,"Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.",-1
5651,Ses03M_script03_1_M017,Who knows?,-1
5652,Ses03M_script03_1_M018,No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,-1
5653,Ses03M_script03_1_M019,"Well, it depends on how well we've played.",-1
5654,Ses03M_script03_1_M020,"Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.",-1
5655,Ses03M_script03_1_M021,"No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",-1
5656,Ses03M_script03_1_M022,"Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense?",-1
5657,Ses03M_script03_1_M023,Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.,-1
5658,Ses03M_script03_1_M024,Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,-1
5659,Ses03M_script03_1_M025,"I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see?",-1
5660,Ses03M_script03_1_M026,You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,-1
5661,Ses03M_script03_1_M027,Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,-1
5662,Ses03M_script03_1_M028,The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,-1
5663,Ses03M_script03_1_M029,Horrible little thing.,-1
5664,Ses03M_script03_1_M030,I hated it.,-1
5665,Ses03M_script03_1_M031,How long did that rile last?,-1
5666,Ses03M_script03_1_M032,"Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-",-1
5667,Ses03M_script03_1_M033,you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,-1
5668,Ses03M_script03_1_M034,That was a rouser wasn't it?,-1
5669,Ses03M_script03_1_M035,I didn't hit you very hard.,3
5670,Ses03M_script03_1_M036,I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].,-1
5671,Ses03M_script03_1_M037,We were very much younger then.,-1
5672,Ses03M_script03_1_M038,The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,-1
5673,Ses03M_script03_2_F000,"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",3
5674,Ses03M_script03_2_F001,Presents?  A trivial little broach.,0
5675,Ses03M_script03_2_F002,Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,-1
5676,Ses03M_script03_2_F003,No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,3
5677,Ses03M_script03_2_F004,Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,3
5678,Ses03M_script03_2_F005,Well what of it?,-1
5679,Ses03M_script03_2_F006,"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",3
5680,Ses03M_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything.",-1
5681,Ses03M_script03_2_F008,"Look, I'm bored with this conversation.",-1
5682,Ses03M_script03_2_F009,No thanks.,-1
5683,Ses03M_script03_2_F010,I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,0
5684,Ses03M_script03_2_F011,I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,0
5685,Ses03M_script03_2_F012,It's become a habit with you.,3
5686,Ses03M_script03_2_F013,Don't be so stupid.,-1
5687,Ses03M_script03_2_F014,What?,0
5688,Ses03M_script03_2_F015,[BREATHING],-1
5689,Ses03M_script03_2_F016,"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",3
5690,Ses03M_script03_2_F017,That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,3
5691,Ses03M_script03_2_F018,No it isn't.,-1
5692,Ses03M_script03_2_F019,"Oh, be quiet.",-1
5693,Ses03M_script03_2_F020,I think you should have some more brandy...,-1
5694,Ses03M_script03_2_F021,...cause really,-1
5695,Ses03M_script03_2_F022,it doesn't seem to be working on you.,-1
5696,Ses03M_script03_2_F023,Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.,-1
5697,Ses03M_script03_2_F024,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",0
5698,Ses03M_script03_2_F025,They sting.,0
5699,Ses03M_script03_2_F026,I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.,-1
5700,Ses03M_script03_2_F027,"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",-1
5701,Ses03M_script03_2_F028,Mind your business.,0
5702,Ses03M_script03_2_F029,You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,0
5703,Ses03M_script03_2_F030,You've always had a weak head.,0
5704,Ses03M_script03_2_F031,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",0
5705,Ses03M_script03_2_F032,Shut up.,0
5706,Ses03M_script03_2_F033,"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",0
5707,Ses03M_script03_2_F034,Why?,-1
5708,Ses03M_script03_2_F035,There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.,-1
5709,Ses03M_script03_2_F036,They are away in Tunis.,3
5710,Ses03M_script03_2_F037,"Turn it on again, please.",-1
5711,Ses03M_script03_2_F038,Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,0
5712,Ses03M_script03_2_F039,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,0
5713,Ses03M_script03_2_F040,Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,0
5714,Ses03M_script03_2_F041,"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",0
5715,Ses03M_script03_2_F042,"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",0
5716,Ses03M_script03_2_F043,"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",0
5717,Ses03M_script03_2_F044,"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",0
5718,Ses03M_script03_2_F045,Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.,0
5719,Ses03M_script03_2_M000,Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,3
5720,Ses03M_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,-1
5721,Ses03M_script03_2_M002,Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,-1
5722,Ses03M_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,0
5723,Ses03M_script03_2_M004,You must admit he was in love with you.,0
5724,Ses03M_script03_2_M005,You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,0
5725,Ses03M_script03_2_M006,And what about me?,0
5726,Ses03M_script03_2_M007,"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",0
5727,Ses03M_script03_2_M008,"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",0
5728,Ses03M_script03_2_M009,You want some brandy?,3
5729,Ses03M_script03_2_M010,I'll have a little I think.,3
5730,Ses03M_script03_2_M011,No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,0
5731,Ses03M_script03_2_M012,Oh my...just because I just...okay...,0
5732,Ses03M_script03_2_M013,...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.,-1
5733,Ses03M_script03_2_M014,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,0
5734,Ses03M_script03_2_M015,Really Amanda.,-1
5735,Ses03M_script03_2_M016,Nothing.,-1
5736,Ses03M_script03_2_M017,Going out somewhere dear?,-1
5737,Ses03M_script03_2_M018,That reply has broken my heart.,-1
5738,Ses03M_script03_2_M019,Actually that's perfectly true.,3
5739,Ses03M_script03_2_M020,Yes it is.,3
5740,Ses03M_script03_2_M021,I think that,3
5741,Ses03M_script03_2_M022,"perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable.",-1
5742,Ses03M_script03_2_M023,"Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",-1
5743,Ses03M_script03_2_M024,Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,-1
5744,Ses03M_script03_2_M025,They snap.,-1
5745,Ses03M_script03_2_M026,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,-1
5746,Ses03M_script03_2_M027,I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?,-1
5747,Ses03M_script03_2_M028,"Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",-1
5748,Ses03M_script03_2_M029,I'm not in the least bit drunk.,0
5749,Ses03M_script03_2_M030,"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",0
5750,Ses03M_script03_2_M031,"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",0
5751,Ses03M_script03_2_M032,We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,0
5752,Ses03M_script03_2_M033,"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",0
5753,Ses03M_script03_2_M034,You better turn that off.,0
5754,Ses03M_script03_2_M035,Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,-1
5755,Ses03M_script03_2_M036,Well there are people downstairs I suppose.,-1
5756,Ses03M_script03_2_M037,"Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.",-1
5757,Ses03M_script03_2_M038,No I'll do no such thing.,0
5758,Ses03M_script03_2_M039,"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",0
5759,Ses03M_script03_2_M040,Turn it--Turn it off.,0
5760,Ses03M_script03_2_M041,Very amusing indeed.,0
5761,Ses03M_script03_2_M042,"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",0
5762,Ses03M_script03_2_M043,You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,0
5763,Ses03M_script03_2_M044,Just shut up.,0
5764,Ses03M_script03_2_M045,shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,0
5765,Ses03M_script03_2_M046,Oh.,0
5766,Ses04F_impro01_F000,"Hi.  Um, excuse me I've been to, like, five of the desks here and nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is I need to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  Can you possibly help me?",-1
5767,Ses04F_impro01_F001,Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.,-1
5768,Ses04F_impro01_F002,Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.,-1
5769,Ses04F_impro01_F003,Okay.  I did-,-1
5770,Ses04F_impro01_F004,I did exactly what they told me to do.,0
5771,Ses04F_impro01_F005,I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,-1
5772,Ses04F_impro01_F006,I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,-1
5773,Ses04F_impro01_F007,"Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?",-1
5774,Ses04F_impro01_F008,I've been to the back of the line five times.,0
5775,Ses04F_impro01_F009,Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,0
5776,Ses04F_impro01_F010,"Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.",0
5777,Ses04F_impro01_F011,I have been waiting for over an hour.,-1
5778,Ses04F_impro01_F012,I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.,0
5779,Ses04F_impro01_F013,Look can you not just help me?,-1
5780,Ses04F_impro01_F014,I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.,0
5781,Ses04F_impro01_F015,No.  No.  No. No. You have to help me.,-1
5782,Ses04F_impro01_F016,This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,0
5783,Ses04F_impro01_F017,That's like the whole purpose of you being here.,-1
5784,Ses04F_impro01_F018,I- I- I'm testing your patience?,-1
5785,Ses04F_impro01_F019,I'm testing your patience?,0
5786,Ses04F_impro01_F020,Yeah.  You have to be here all day.,-1
5787,Ses04F_impro01_F021,I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.,0
5788,Ses04F_impro01_F022,"Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.",0
5789,Ses04F_impro01_M000,"Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?",-1
5790,Ses04F_impro01_M001,"You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?",-1
5791,Ses04F_impro01_M002,Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.,-1
5792,Ses04F_impro01_M003,Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.,-1
5793,Ses04F_impro01_M004,Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,-1
5794,Ses04F_impro01_M005,I've got a life too ma'am,0
5795,Ses04F_impro01_M006,and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day.,-1

5799,Ses04F_impro01_M010,fill out this form and wait,-1
5800,Ses04F_impro01_M011,You're going to have to go back again.,0
5801,Ses04F_impro01_M012,This whole area here you didn't initial,-1
5802,Ses04F_impro01_M013,and you filled out-,-1
5803,Ses04F_impro01_M014,Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.,0
5804,Ses04F_impro01_M015,This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place,-1
5805,Ses04F_impro01_M016,"Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that",-1
5806,Ses04F_impro01_M017,"and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form.",-1
5807,Ses04F_impro01_M018,Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really,-1
5808,Ses04F_impro01_M019,I can't help you right now.  Do you understand that?,-1
5809,Ses04F_impro01_M020,Look I'm going on my lunch break right now.  So you're just going to have to take this form and go to the back of the line.,-1
5810,Ses04F_impro01_M021,like I said before right now.,0

5819,Ses04F_impro02_F004,I need you to believe that too.  How am I supposed to believe everything's going to be okay if you don't?,-1
5820,Ses04F_impro02_F005,Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,2
5821,Ses04F_impro02_F006,Do you think I want to leave you?,2
5822,Ses04F_impro02_F007,I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,2

5824,Ses04F_impro02_F009,And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,2
5825,Ses04F_impro02_F010,I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.,-1
5826,Ses04F_impro02_F011,What's that supposed to mean?,2
5827,Ses04F_impro02_F012,Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,0
5828,Ses04F_impro02_F013,What do you want me to do?,-1

5830,Ses04F_impro02_F015,"You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",-1
5831,Ses04F_impro02_F016,I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,-1
5832,Ses04F_impro02_F017,Thanks that helps.,0

5838,Ses04F_impro02_F023,I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,2
5839,Ses04F_impro02_F024,Fine.,2
5840,Ses04F_impro02_M000,So you're leaving tomorrow.,2

5842,Ses04F_impro02_M002,I don't see [BREATHING],-1
5843,Ses04F_impro02_M003,"I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.",-1
5844,Ses04F_impro02_M004,"And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",2
5845,Ses04F_impro02_M005,You don't know that.,-1
5846,Ses04F_impro02_M006,"I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",-1

5848,Ses04F_impro02_M008,You have a choice.,-1
5849,Ses04F_impro02_M009,I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.,-1
5850,Ses04F_impro02_M010,You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,-1
5851,Ses04F_impro02_M011,It's just not going to work out without you here.,-1
5852,Ses04F_impro02_M012,I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,2
5853,Ses04F_impro02_M013,Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,-1
5854,Ses04F_impro02_M014,I can't deal with this emotionally.,-1

5856,Ses04F_impro02_M016,You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,-1
5857,Ses04F_impro02_M017,Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,-1
5858,Ses04F_impro02_M018,That's all I'm saying... No you don't.,0
5859,Ses04F_impro02_M019,It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.,-1

5862,Ses04F_impro02_M022,Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?,-1
5863,Ses04F_impro02_M023,Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.,-1
5864,Ses04F_impro02_M024,"I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",2
5865,Ses04F_impro02_M025,You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,2
5866,Ses04F_impro02_M026,Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.,2
5867,Ses04F_impro03_F000,I have something to tell you.,1

5985,Ses04F_impro04_F014,I mean it's not like this is an,0
5986,Ses04F_impro04_F015,extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.,0
5987,Ses04F_impro04_F016,"Okay. Okay, Fine.",0
5988,Ses04F_impro04_F017,Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?,0

5999,Ses04F_impro04_F028,Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.,-1
6000,Ses04F_impro04_F029,I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.,-1

6002,Ses04F_impro04_F031,I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,0
6003,Ses04F_impro04_F032,Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.,-1

I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?

6319,Ses04F_impro08_M015,"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",0
6320,Ses04F_impro08_M016,You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.,0

6337,Ses04F_script01_1_F001,How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.,-1
6338,Ses04F_script01_1_F002,When?,-1
6339,Ses04F_script01_1_F003,What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,-1
6340,Ses04F_script01_1_F004,Did you talk to him?,2
6341,Ses04F_script01_1_F005,He cried hard?,-1
6342,Ses04F_script01_1_F006,What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,-1
6343,Ses04F_script01_1_F007,He's getting just like after he died.,-1
6344,Ses04F_script01_1_F008,What's the meaning in that?,-1
6345,Ses04F_script01_1_F009,What?,-1
6346,Ses04F_script01_1_F010,What do you mean dishonest?,-1
6347,Ses04F_script01_1_F011,"What do you want to do, argue with him?",0
6348,Ses04F_script01_1_F012,You can't say that to him.,0
6349,Ses04F_script01_1_F013,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,0
6350,Ses04F_script01_1_F014,To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,0
6351,Ses04F_script01_1_F015,The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,0
6352,Ses04F_script01_1_F016,Why?,-1
6353,Ses04F_script01_1_F017,Well I got an idea but what's the story?,-1
6354,Ses04F_script01_1_F018,"Well that's only your business, Chris.",3
6355,Ses04F_script01_1_F019,What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,0
6356,Ses04F_script01_1_F020,Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-,-1
6357,Ses04F_script01_1_F021,I'm just saying.,-1
6358,Ses04F_script01_1_F022,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,0
6359,Ses04F_script01_1_F023,"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",0
6360,Ses04F_script01_1_F024,"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",0
6361,Ses04F_script01_1_F025,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,3
6362,Ses04F_script01_1_F026,Did you ask Annie yet?,-1
6363,Ses04F_script01_1_F027,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,-1
6364,Ses04F_script01_1_F028,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,-1
6365,Ses04F_script01_1_F029,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,0
6366,Ses04F_script01_1_F030,Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,0
6367,Ses04F_script01_1_F031,"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",-1
6368,Ses04F_script01_1_F032,You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,0
6369,Ses04F_script01_1_F033,Just give it some more thought.,-1
6370,Ses04F_script01_1_F034,What the hell is this?,-1
6371,Ses04F_script01_1_F035,Are you crazy?,0
6372,Ses04F_script01_1_F036,You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,0
6373,Ses04F_script01_1_F037,Must you be inspired?,0
6374,Ses04F_script01_1_F038,You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,-1
6375,Ses04F_script01_1_F039,Well you don't want to think that way.,-1
6376,Ses04F_script01_1_F040,Alright but don't think that way,0
6377,Ses04F_script01_1_F041,"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",0
6378,Ses04F_script01_1_F042,But don't think that way.  You hear me?,0
6379,Ses04F_script01_1_F043,I don't understand you do I?,-1
6380,Ses04F_script01_1_F044,Yeah.  I can see that.,0
6381,Ses04F_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,3
6382,Ses04F_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,-1
6383,Ses04F_script01_1_M002,About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,-1
6384,Ses04F_script01_1_M003,"I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.",-1
6385,Ses04F_script01_1_M004,"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",2
6386,Ses04F_script01_1_M005,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,2
6387,Ses04F_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,-1
6388,Ses04F_script01_1_M007,"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",-1
6389,Ses04F_script01_1_M008,"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",-1
6390,Ses04F_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,0
6391,Ses04F_script01_1_M010,I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,0
6392,Ses04F_script01_1_M011,"Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",-1
6393,Ses04F_script01_1_M012,We've got to say it to him.,0
6394,Ses04F_script01_1_M013,For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,0
6395,Ses04F_script01_1_M014,Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,-1
6396,Ses04F_script01_1_M015,"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",-1
6397,Ses04F_script01_1_M016,You know why.,3
6398,Ses04F_script01_1_M017,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,3
6399,Ses04F_script01_1_M018,You know it's not only my business.,-1
6400,Ses04F_script01_1_M019,Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,-1
6401,Ses04F_script01_1_M020,Then it isn't just my business.,0
6402,Ses04F_script01_1_M021,Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,0
6403,Ses04F_script01_1_M022,Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,0
6404,Ses04F_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl.,-1
6405,Ses04F_script01_1_M024,"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",-1
6406,Ses04F_script01_1_M025,To hell with that.,0
6407,Ses04F_script01_1_M026,I wanted to get this settled first.,2
6408,Ses04F_script01_1_M027,"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",-1
6409,Ses04F_script01_1_M028,"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",0
6410,Ses04F_script01_1_M029,So what I'm not fast with women.,0
6411,Ses04F_script01_1_M030,Because it is.,0
6412,Ses04F_script01_1_M031,I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,-1
6413,Ses04F_script01_1_M032,"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",2
6414,Ses04F_script01_1_M033,Alright then mom.,-1
6415,Ses04F_script01_1_M034,"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",0
6416,Ses04F_script01_1_M035,"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",-1

6420,Ses04F_script01_1_M039,"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",-1
6421,Ses04F_script01_1_M040,I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,-1
6422,Ses04F_script01_1_M041,Yes on this I would.,-1
6423,Ses04F_script01_1_M042,Then you help me stay here.,-1
6424,Ses04F_script01_1_M043,I know.  Just you help me stay here.,-1
6425,Ses04F_script01_1_M044,I am thinking that way.,-1
6426,Ses04F_script01_1_M045,No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,-1
6427,Ses04F_script01_2_F000,Why did he invite her?,0
6428,Ses04F_script01_2_F001,It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,0
6429,Ses04F_script01_2_F002,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,-1
6430,Ses04F_script01_2_F003,She's not going to marry him.,-1
6431,Ses04F_script01_2_F004,It's got that about it.,-1
6432,Ses04F_script01_2_F005,"What's going on here, Joe?",0

6435,Ses04F_script01_2_F008,Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?,0
6436,Ses04F_script01_2_F009,Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,0
6437,Ses04F_script01_2_F010,Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,0
6438,Ses04F_script01_2_F011,"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",-1
6439,Ses04F_script01_2_F012,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",-1
6440,Ses04F_script01_2_F013,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",-1
6441,Ses04F_script01_2_F014,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",-1
6442,Ses04F_script01_2_F015,"Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?",-1
6443,Ses04F_script01_2_F016,"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",0
6444,Ses04F_script01_2_F017,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",-1
6445,Ses04F_script01_2_F018,Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,-1
6446,Ses04F_script01_2_F019,You above all have got to believe.  You.,-1
6447,Ses04F_script01_2_F020,Just don't stop believing.,-1
6448,Ses04F_script01_2_F021,I can't help it.,-1
6449,Ses04F_script01_2_M000,Why does that bother you?,3
6450,Ses04F_script01_2_M001,Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,3
6451,Ses04F_script01_2_M002,What do you mean?  He was brought up next door to the girl his whole life.  Why shouldn't he want to see her again?,-1
6452,Ses04F_script01_2_M003,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,-1
6453,Ses04F_script01_2_M004,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,3
6454,Ses04F_script01_2_M005,Well so what.,-1
6455,Ses04F_script01_2_M006,Listen kid.,-1
6456,Ses04F_script01_2_M007,"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",3
6457,Ses04F_script01_2_M008,You can't read her mind.,3
6458,Ses04F_script01_2_M009,How do you know why she waited?,-1
6459,Ses04F_script01_2_M010,Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,-1
6460,Ses04F_script01_2_M011,What do you want me to do?,-1
6461,Ses04F_script01_2_M012,But Kate-,-1
6462,Ses04F_script01_2_M013,Calm yourself.,-1
6463,Ses04F_script01_2_M014,Calm yourself.,-1
6464,Ses04F_script01_2_M015,Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.,-1
6465,Ses04F_script01_2_M016,Why me above all?,-1
6466,Ses04F_script01_2_M017,"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",0
6467,Ses04F_script01_2_M018,What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?,-1
6468,Ses04F_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,-1
6469,Ses04F_script01_3_F001,It's okay.  It's a good thing.,-1
6470,Ses04F_script01_3_F002,You know it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,-1
6471,Ses04F_script01_3_F003,"Not sorry, no but I'm not staying.",-1
6472,Ses04F_script01_3_F004,"In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",-1
6473,Ses04F_script01_3_F005,You saw that and you- you've been kind of-,-1
6474,Ses04F_script01_3_F006,Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,-1
6475,Ses04F_script01_3_F007,"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",-1
6476,Ses04F_script01_3_F008,From her point of view why else would I come?,-1
6477,Ses04F_script01_3_F009,I guess this is why I came.,1
6478,Ses04F_script01_3_F010,"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",1
6479,Ses04F_script01_3_F011,I almost got married two years ago.,-1
6480,Ses04F_script01_3_F012,You started to write me.,1
6481,Ses04F_script01_3_F013,Every day since.,1
6482,Ses04F_script01_3_F014,"I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",1
6483,Ses04F_script01_3_F015,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,1
6484,Ses04F_script01_3_F016,Not like that you're not.,-1
6485,Ses04F_script01_3_F017,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.",-1
6486,Ses04F_script01_3_F018,What is it Chris?,-1
6487,Ses04F_script01_3_F019,"No.  What is it Chris, your mother?",-1
6488,Ses04F_script01_3_F020,Well then what's wrong?  Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,-1
6489,Ses04F_script01_3_F021,You've got to tell me.,-1
6490,Ses04F_script01_3_F022,It wouldn't work this way.,-1
6491,Ses04F_script01_3_F023,"Yeah, sure.",3
6492,Ses04F_script01_3_F024,How many?,2
6493,Ses04F_script01_3_F025,"Oh, gees.",-1
6494,Ses04F_script01_3_F026,And do you still feel that way?,-1
6495,Ses04F_script01_3_F027,"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything",-1
6496,Ses04F_script01_3_F028,that includes me.  And your money there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.,-1
6497,Ses04F_script01_3_F029,You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.,-1
6498,Ses04F_script01_3_F030,What'll I do with a fortune?,1
6499,Ses04F_script01_3_M000,I know it went out of style didn't it?,-1
6500,Ses04F_script01_3_M001,You're not sorry you came.,-1
6501,Ses04F_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
6502,Ses04F_script01_3_M003,Well.,-1
6503,Ses04F_script01_3_M004,What?,0
6504,Ses04F_script01_3_M005,The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we're all set.,-1
6505,Ses04F_script01_3_M006,How did you know?,-1
6506,Ses04F_script01_3_M007,Wouldn't you want to?,-1
6507,Ses04F_script01_3_M008,I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,3
6508,Ses04F_script01_3_M009,"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",1
6509,Ses04F_script01_3_M010,I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,1
6510,Ses04F_script01_3_M011,I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I,1
6511,Ses04F_script01_3_M012,"wanted some place we'd never been, a place where we'd be brand new to each other.",-1
6512,Ses04F_script01_3_M013,"You think this is wrong, this chair, this yard.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",-1
6513,Ses04F_script01_3_M014,And he's gone forever.  You're sure?,3
6514,Ses04F_script01_3_M015,Why didn't you?,-1
6515,Ses04F_script01_3_M016,You felt something that far back?,-1
6516,Ses04F_script01_3_M017,"Ann, why didn't you let me know?",-1
6517,Ses04F_script01_3_M018,"Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.",1
6518,Ses04F_script01_3_M019,"I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",1
6519,Ses04F_script01_3_M020,"Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1
6520,Ses04F_script01_3_M021,I kissed you.,-1
6521,Ses04F_script01_3_M022,Let's drive some place.  I want to be alone with you.,-1
6522,Ses04F_script01_3_M023,"No, nothing like that.",2
6523,Ses04F_script01_3_M024,Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,2
6524,Ses04F_script01_3_M025,I don't know where to start.,-1
6525,Ses04F_script01_3_M026,There's so many things mixed up.,2
6526,Ses04F_script01_3_M027,You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,2
6527,Ses04F_script01_3_M028,Well I lost them.,2
6528,Ses04F_script01_3_M029,Just about all.,2
6529,Ses04F_script01_3_M030,It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,2
6530,Ses04F_script01_3_M031,"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",2
6531,Ses04F_script01_3_M032,I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,2
6532,Ses04F_script01_3_M033,They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,2
6533,Ses04F_script01_3_M034,"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",2
6534,Ses04F_script01_3_M035,a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,2
6535,Ses04F_script01_3_M036,And then I came home and it was amazing.,2
6536,Ses04F_script01_3_M037,There was no meaning in it here.,-1
6537,Ses04F_script01_3_M038,The whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident. Then I went to work with father and that whole rat race again.,-1
6538,Ses04F_script01_3_M039,"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",2
6539,Ses04F_script01_3_M040,because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,2
6540,Ses04F_script01_3_M041,"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",2
6541,Ses04F_script01_3_M042,I mean you can take those things out of war but,-1
6542,Ses04F_script01_3_M043,"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",2
6543,Ses04F_script01_3_M044,Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,2
6544,Ses04F_script01_3_M045,I guess that included you.,2
6545,Ses04F_script01_3_M046,"I want you now, Annie.",-1
6546,Ses04F_script01_3_M047,"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",1
6547,Ses04F_script02_1_F000,Fine.,3
6548,Ses04F_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,-1
6549,Ses04F_script02_1_F002,It's not yours.,-1
6550,Ses04F_script02_1_F003,It's ours.  It's mine too.,-1
6551,Ses04F_script02_1_F004,You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,-1
6552,Ses04F_script02_1_F005,Yes.,-1
6553,Ses04F_script02_1_F006,I'm cold.,-1
6554,Ses04F_script02_1_F007,It's after eleven let's go home.,0
6555,Ses04F_script02_1_F008,There is no point in coming down here.,0
6556,Ses04F_script02_1_F009,That's my point.,-1
6557,Ses04F_script02_1_F010,So let's go home.,-1
6558,Ses04F_script02_1_F011,Not particularly.,-1
6559,Ses04F_script02_1_F012,I just don't.  It's stupid.,0
6560,Ses04F_script02_1_F013,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",0
6561,Ses04F_script02_1_F014,What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,0
6562,Ses04F_script02_1_F015,"Oh, Augie.",-1
6563,Ses04F_script02_1_F016,I'm just not.,0
6564,Ses04F_script02_1_F017,Yes.,0
6565,Ses04F_script02_1_F018,Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,-1
6566,Ses04F_script02_1_F019,We didn't see them the first time either.,0
6567,Ses04F_script02_1_F020,That's the wind.,-1
6568,Ses04F_script02_1_F021,About what?,0
6569,Ses04F_script02_1_F022,It's ridiculous.,0
6570,Ses04F_script02_1_M000,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,1
6571,Ses04F_script02_1_M001,"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid to miss it.  How you doing?",-1
6572,Ses04F_script02_1_M002,"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",1
6573,Ses04F_script02_1_M003,"although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?",-1
6574,Ses04F_script02_1_M004,"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",-1
6575,Ses04F_script02_1_M005,"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",-1
6576,Ses04F_script02_1_M006,Whose is it?,-1
6577,Ses04F_script02_1_M007,Well sure.,-1
6578,Ses04F_script02_1_M008,"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",-1
6579,Ses04F_script02_1_M009,I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,1
6580,Ses04F_script02_1_M010,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",3
6581,Ses04F_script02_1_M011,"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",1
6582,Ses04F_script02_1_M012,I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,-1
6583,Ses04F_script02_1_M013,"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?",-1
6584,Ses04F_script02_1_M014,Do you want my jacket?,-1
6585,Ses04F_script02_1_M015,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,-1
6586,Ses04F_script02_1_M016,Right.,-1
6587,Ses04F_script02_1_M017,That's my point too.,3
6588,Ses04F_script02_1_M018,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",-1
6589,Ses04F_script02_1_M019,Why not?,-1
6590,Ses04F_script02_1_M020,Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,-1
6591,Ses04F_script02_1_M021,Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,1
6592,Ses04F_script02_1_M022,"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",-1
6593,Ses04F_script02_1_M023,This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,1
6594,Ses04F_script02_1_M024,"Yeah, they do.",-1
6595,Ses04F_script02_1_M025,Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,-1
6596,Ses04F_script02_1_M026,"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",1
6597,Ses04F_script02_1_M027,a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,-1
6598,Ses04F_script02_1_M028,For real?,-1
6599,Ses04F_script02_1_M029,I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,-1
6600,Ses04F_script02_1_M030,We weren't in a good spot.,-1
6601,Ses04F_script02_1_M031,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,0
6602,Ses04F_script02_1_M032,"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",1
6603,Ses04F_script02_1_M033,"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",1
6604,Ses04F_script02_1_M034,Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,1
6605,Ses04F_script02_1_M035,No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,1
6606,Ses04F_script02_1_M036,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,1
6607,Ses04F_script02_1_M037,It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,1
6608,Ses04F_script02_1_M038,They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,1
6609,Ses04F_script02_1_M039,where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,1
6610,Ses04F_script02_1_M040,"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",1
6611,Ses04F_script02_1_M041,Well so what do you think?,-1
6612,Ses04F_script02_1_M042,What I said.,-1
6613,Ses04F_script02_2_F000,About what?,-1
6614,Ses04F_script02_2_F001,It's ridiculous.,-1
6615,Ses04F_script02_2_F002,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,0
6616,Ses04F_script02_2_F003,"Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",-1
6617,Ses04F_script02_2_F004,Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,-1
6618,Ses04F_script02_2_F005,Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,0
6619,Ses04F_script02_2_F006,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,0
6620,Ses04F_script02_2_F007,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",0
6621,Ses04F_script02_2_F008,We totally skipped. Right.,3
6622,Ses04F_script02_2_F009,"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",0
6623,Ses04F_script02_2_F010,We never do.  Do we have we ever?,0
6624,Ses04F_script02_2_F011,Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,0
6625,Ses04F_script02_2_F012,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.",-1
6626,Ses04F_script02_2_F013,"God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,",-1
6627,Ses04F_script02_2_F014,and the fish won't show up.,0
6628,Ses04F_script02_2_F015,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,-1
6629,Ses04F_script02_2_F016,I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,-1
6630,Ses04F_script02_2_F017,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",-1
6631,Ses04F_script02_2_F018,Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.,-1
6632,Ses04F_script02_2_F019,We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,2
6633,Ses04F_script02_2_F020,"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",2
6634,Ses04F_script02_2_F021,right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,2
6635,Ses04F_script02_2_F022,"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",2
6636,Ses04F_script02_2_F023,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",2
6637,Ses04F_script02_2_F024,I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,2
6638,Ses04F_script02_2_F025,No.,3
6639,Ses04F_script02_2_F026,No.,2
6640,Ses04F_script02_2_F027,No.  No.,-1
6641,Ses04F_script02_2_F028,No.,-1
6642,Ses04F_script02_2_F029,No.,-1
6643,Ses04F_script02_2_F030,No.,-1
6644,Ses04F_script02_2_F031,No.,0
6645,Ses04F_script02_2_F032,I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,-1
6646,Ses04F_script02_2_F033,"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",0
6647,Ses04F_script02_2_F034,"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",0
6648,Ses04F_script02_2_F035,But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,-1
6649,Ses04F_script02_2_F036,"This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",-1
6650,Ses04F_script02_2_F037,"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",2
6651,Ses04F_script02_2_F038,I didn't say that.,-1
6652,Ses04F_script02_2_F039,"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",-1
6653,Ses04F_script02_2_F040,Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,-1
6654,Ses04F_script02_2_F041,somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,2
6655,Ses04F_script02_2_F042,Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.,-1
6656,Ses04F_script02_2_F043,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",1
6657,Ses04F_script02_2_F044,"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",1
6658,Ses04F_script02_2_F045,Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,1
6659,Ses04F_script02_2_F046,I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,1
6660,Ses04F_script02_2_F047,Or not.,-1
6661,Ses04F_script02_2_M000,"Well, so what do you think?",3
6662,Ses04F_script02_2_M001,What I said.,-1
6663,Ses04F_script02_2_M002,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,-1
6664,Ses04F_script02_2_M003,I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,-1
6665,Ses04F_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
6666,Ses04F_script02_2_M005,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?",-1
6667,Ses04F_script02_2_M006,Well then what's bugging you?,-1
6668,Ses04F_script02_2_M007,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",-1
6669,Ses04F_script02_2_M008,Why not?,-1
6670,Ses04F_script02_2_M009,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",-1
6671,Ses04F_script02_2_M010,Why not?,-1
6672,Ses04F_script02_2_M011,We've missed them twice that's not ever.,-1
6673,Ses04F_script02_2_M012,We'll see them this year.,-1
6674,Ses04F_script02_2_M013,I thought you wanted to see it.,-1
6675,Ses04F_script02_2_M014,"No, of course not.",-1
6676,Ses04F_script02_2_M015,It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,-1
6677,Ses04F_script02_2_M016,I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,-1
6678,Ses04F_script02_2_M017,Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.,-1
6679,Ses04F_script02_2_M018,"Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.",-1
6680,Ses04F_script02_2_M019,Wait a minute.  I've got it.,3
6681,Ses04F_script02_2_M020,"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",3
6682,Ses04F_script02_2_M021,"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",1
6683,Ses04F_script02_2_M022,Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,-1
6684,Ses04F_script02_2_M023,You want me to get some champagne?,3
6685,Ses04F_script02_2_M024,Take off our shoes?,-1
6686,Ses04F_script02_2_M025,Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,-1
6687,Ses04F_script02_2_M026,Want to get married again?,-1
6688,Ses04F_script02_2_M027,What?  What do you want a divorce?,-1
6689,Ses04F_script02_2_M028,A vacation?,-1
6690,Ses04F_script02_2_M029,"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",-1
6691,Ses04F_script02_2_M030,Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.,-1
6692,Ses04F_script02_2_M031,"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",-1
6693,Ses04F_script02_2_M032,Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,-1
6694,Ses04F_script02_2_M033,"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",-1
6695,Ses04F_script02_2_M034,"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",-1
6696,Ses04F_script02_2_M035,"you know what you get Carla, this.",-1
6697,Ses04F_script02_2_M036,Yes it is.,-1
6698,Ses04F_script02_2_M037,Right.,-1
6699,Ses04F_script02_2_M038,"No, I know me either.",-1
6700,Ses04F_script02_2_M039,I'm doing the best I can.,-1
6701,Ses04F_script02_2_M040,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,2
6702,Ses04F_script02_2_M041,"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",2
6703,Ses04F_script02_2_M042,Yeah?,-1
6704,Ses04F_script02_2_M043,"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",3
6705,Ses04F_script02_2_M044,I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,3
6706,Ses04F_script02_2_M045,I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.,-1
6707,Ses04F_script02_2_M046,Well look at what we got here.,1
6708,Ses04F_script02_2_M047,It's not champagne.,3
6709,Ses04F_script02_2_M048,You still cold?  Do you want to go home?,-1
6710,Ses04F_script02_2_M049,"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",-1
6711,Ses04F_script02_2_M050,Or not.,-1
6712,Ses04F_script03_1_F000,Do you think it's them?,-1
6713,Ses04F_script03_1_F001,Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,-1
6714,Ses04F_script03_1_F002,Well what are we going to do?,-1
6715,Ses04F_script03_1_F003,Now and always sweet.,-1
6716,Ses04F_script03_1_F004,It was bound to come sooner or later.,-1
6717,Ses04F_script03_1_F005,Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,1
6718,Ses04F_script03_1_F006,Behave exquisitely.,1
6719,Ses04F_script03_1_F007,Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,1
6720,Ses04F_script03_1_F008,What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,-1
6721,Ses04F_script03_1_F009,It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,1
6722,Ses04F_script03_1_F010,"Yes, meaning just that.",-1
6723,Ses04F_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,1
6724,Ses04F_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,3
6725,Ses04F_script03_1_F013,"If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",-1
6726,Ses04F_script03_1_F014,"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",1
6727,Ses04F_script03_1_F015,We always want to bicker and fight.,-1
6728,Ses04F_script03_1_F016,"Oh, dear shall we like that?",-1
6729,Ses04F_script03_1_F017,What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,3
6730,Ses04F_script03_1_F018,"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",-1
6731,Ses04F_script03_1_F019,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",-1
6732,Ses04F_script03_1_F020,"Elliott, worms don't pop.",-1
6733,Ses04F_script03_1_F021,"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",1
6734,Ses04F_script03_1_F022,Which particular one?,1
6735,Ses04F_script03_1_F023,"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",1
6736,Ses04F_script03_1_F024,"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",1
6737,Ses04F_script03_1_F025,It went on intermittently for days.,-1
6738,Ses04F_script03_1_F026,It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,1
6739,Ses04F_script03_1_F027,That was the first time you ever hit me.,-1
6740,Ses04F_script03_1_F028,Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,1
6741,Ses04F_script03_1_F029,"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",1
6742,Ses04F_script03_1_F030,And very much sillier.,1
6743,Ses04F_script03_1_M000,Good God.,-1
6744,Ses04F_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,-1
6745,Ses04F_script03_1_M002,It must be them then.,-1
6746,Ses04F_script03_1_M003,"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",-1
6747,Ses04F_script03_1_M004,I don't care then.,-1
6748,Ses04F_script03_1_M005,Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number.,-1
6749,Ses04F_script03_1_M006,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,1
6750,Ses04F_script03_1_M007,With the most perfect poise.,1
6751,Ses04F_script03_1_M008,"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",1
6752,Ses04F_script03_1_M009,"Don't say that, my darling.",3
6753,Ses04F_script03_1_M010,Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.,-1
6754,Ses04F_script03_1_M011,What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?,-1
6755,Ses04F_script03_1_M012,"You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.",-1
6756,Ses04F_script03_1_M013,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,-1
6757,Ses04F_script03_1_M014,"Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths",-1
6758,Ses04F_script03_1_M015,flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,-1
6759,Ses04F_script03_1_M016,Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.,-1
6760,Ses04F_script03_1_M017,Well who knows?,3
6761,Ses04F_script03_1_M018,No that fire will fade long with our passion.,-1
6762,Ses04F_script03_1_M019,It all depends on how well we've played.,-1
6763,Ses04F_script03_1_M020,Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.,-1
6764,Ses04F_script03_1_M021,"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",-1
6765,Ses04F_script03_1_M022,So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,-1
6766,Ses04F_script03_1_M023,Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.,-1
6767,Ses04F_script03_1_M024,Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,-1
6768,Ses04F_script03_1_M025,"I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over",-1
6769,Ses04F_script03_1_M026,and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,-1
6770,Ses04F_script03_1_M027,Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,3
6771,Ses04F_script03_1_M028,The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,3
6772,Ses04F_script03_1_M029,Horrible thing.  I hated it.,3
6773,Ses04F_script03_1_M030,How long did that row last?,3
6774,Ses04F_script03_1_M031,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,3
6775,Ses04F_script03_1_M032,"Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?",-1
6776,Ses04F_script03_1_M033,You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.,-1
6777,Ses04F_script03_1_M034,I shall never forget his face.,-1
6778,Ses04F_script03_1_M035,We were very much younger then.,-1
6779,Ses04F_script03_1_M036,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",-1
6780,Ses04F_script03_2_F000,"There was nothing in that, you know that.",-1
6781,Ses04F_script03_2_F001,Presents a trivial little broach.,-1
6782,Ses04F_script03_2_F002,Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,-1
6783,Ses04F_script03_2_F003,I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,-1
6784,Ses04F_script03_2_F004,"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",-1
6785,Ses04F_script03_2_F005,What of it?,0
6786,Ses04F_script03_2_F006,It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,-1
6787,Ses04F_script03_2_F007,"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",-1
6788,Ses04F_script03_2_F008,"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",-1
6789,Ses04F_script03_2_F009,No thanks.,-1
6790,Ses04F_script03_2_F010,I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,-1
6791,Ses04F_script03_2_F011,seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,-1
6792,Ses04F_script03_2_F012,It's become a habit with you.,0
6793,Ses04F_script03_2_F013,"Oh, don't be so stupid.",0
6794,Ses04F_script03_2_F014,What?,0
6795,Ses04F_script03_2_F015,Just making myself fascinating for you.,-1
6796,Ses04F_script03_2_F016,The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,-1
6797,Ses04F_script03_2_F017,"Oh, no it isn't",-1
6798,Ses04F_script03_2_F018,"Oh, be quiet.",-1
6799,Ses04F_script03_2_F019,It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,0
6800,Ses04F_script03_2_F020,Adders don't snap they sting.,0
6801,Ses04F_script03_2_F021,They sting.,0
6802,Ses04F_script03_2_F022,"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",0

6804,Ses04F_script03_2_F024,Mind your own business.,0
6805,Ses04F_script03_2_F025,You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,0
6806,Ses04F_script03_2_F026,You always had a weak head.,0
6807,Ses04F_script03_2_F027,"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",0
6808,Ses04F_script03_2_F028,"Oh, shut up.",0
6809,Ses04F_script03_2_F029,"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",0
6810,Ses04F_script03_2_F030,Why?,0
6811,Ses04F_script03_2_F031,There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,0
6812,Ses04F_script03_2_F032,They're away in Tunis.,-1

6814,Ses04F_script03_2_F034,Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,0
6815,Ses04F_script03_2_F035,You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,0

6820,Ses04F_script03_2_F040,"This is the end do you understand?  The end,",0
6821,Ses04F_script03_2_F041,finally and forever,0
6822,Ses04F_script03_2_F042,"Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",0
6823,Ses04F_script03_2_F043,"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",0
6824,Ses04F_script03_2_F044,I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,0
6825,Ses04F_script03_2_M000,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",3
6826,Ses04F_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,0
6827,Ses04F_script03_2_M002,I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,-1
6828,Ses04F_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,0
6829,Ses04F_script03_2_M004,"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",-1
6830,Ses04F_script03_2_M005,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,0
6831,Ses04F_script03_2_M006,What of it?,0
6832,Ses04F_script03_2_M007,What about me?,0
6833,Ses04F_script03_2_M008,"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",0
6834,Ses04F_script03_2_M009,So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,-1
6835,Ses04F_script03_2_M010,"I'll have some myself, I think.",3
6836,Ses04F_script03_2_M011,No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.,-1
6837,Ses04F_script03_2_M012,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,-1
6838,Ses04F_script03_2_M013,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,-1
6839,Ses04F_script03_2_M014,"Really, Amanda.",0
6840,Ses04F_script03_2_M015,Nothing.,0

6843,Ses04F_script03_2_M018,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",-1
6844,Ses04F_script03_2_M019,"Yes, it is.",-1
6845,Ses04F_script03_2_M020,It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,-1

6847,Ses04F_script03_2_M022,Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,-1

6849,Ses04F_script03_2_M024,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,3
6850,Ses04F_script03_2_M025,I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,-1
6851,Ses04F_script03_2_M026,"You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.",-1
6852,Ses04F_script03_2_M027,I'm not in the least drunk.,0
6853,Ses04F_script03_2_M028,I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,-1
6854,Ses04F_script03_2_M029,Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,-1
6855,Ses04F_script03_2_M030,"They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.",-1
6856,Ses04F_script03_2_M031,Very good idea.  I will.,0
6857,Ses04F_script03_2_M032,You'd better turn that off I think.,-1
6858,Ses04F_script03_2_M033,It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,-1
6859,Ses04F_script03_2_M034,There are people downstairs I suppose.,0
6860,Ses04F_script03_2_M035,This is no time of year for Tunis.,0
6861,Ses04F_script03_2_M036,I'll do no such thing.,-1
6862,Ses04F_script03_2_M037,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,0
6863,Ses04F_script03_2_M038,Turn it off.,-1
6864,Ses04F_script03_2_M039,"Amanda, listen.",0
6865,Ses04F_script03_2_M040,Very amusing.,0

6867,Ses04F_script03_2_M042,You're not going like this.,0
6868,Ses04F_script03_2_M043,You're not.,0

6873,Ses04M_impro01_F002,Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.,3
6874,Ses04M_impro01_F003,"I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.",-1
6875,Ses04M_impro01_F004,I don't have any of,-1
6876,Ses04M_impro01_F005,I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.,-1
6877,Ses04M_impro01_F006,"Nope, I don't. I don't have-",-1
6878,Ses04M_impro01_F007,"No, I can't. That's-",-1
6879,Ses04M_impro01_F008,I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.,-1

6881,Ses04M_impro01_F010,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,",-1
6882,Ses04M_impro01_F011,but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to,-1
6883,Ses04M_impro01_F012,twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,3
6884,Ses04M_impro01_F013,"Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay.",-1
6885,Ses04M_impro01_F014,"And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.",-1
6886,Ses04M_impro01_F015,I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.,-1
6887,Ses04M_impro01_F016,I can't do that.,-1
6888,Ses04M_impro01_F017,"I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",-1
6889,Ses04M_impro01_F018,So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.,0
6890,Ses04M_impro01_F019,Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,0
6891,Ses04M_impro01_F020,The one you just came from.,-1

6894,Ses04M_impro01_M001,"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",-1
6895,Ses04M_impro01_M002,"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",-1
6896,Ses04M_impro01_M003,"Yes, I do.",3
6897,Ses04M_impro01_M004,"This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.",-1
6898,Ses04M_impro01_M005,Don't you -- you don't have-,-1
6899,Ses04M_impro01_M006,are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?,-1
6900,Ses04M_impro01_M007,"But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--",-1
6901,Ses04M_impro01_M008,or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.,-1
6902,Ses04M_impro01_M009,"Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--",-1
6903,Ses04M_impro01_M010,look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not,-1
6904,Ses04M_impro01_M011,What if I pay you money?,-1
6905,Ses04M_impro01_M012,"Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?",-1
6906,Ses04M_impro01_M013,"Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --",-1
6907,Ses04M_impro01_M014,"I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.",-1
6908,Ses04M_impro01_M015,Well I just -- I can't do that right -- can you please just grab the form? All you have to do is grab the form.  I'm not gonna ask anything else of you.,-1
6909,Ses04M_impro01_M016,That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-,-1
6910,Ses04M_impro01_M017,"Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk",-1
6911,Ses04M_impro01_M018,It's not rocket science.,0

6913,Ses04M_impro01_M020,I know it's right over there.,-1
6914,Ses04M_impro01_M021,Why are you being such a bitch?,-1
6915,Ses04M_impro01_M022,"Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?",-1
6916,Ses04M_impro01_M023,"Fine, which line is it?",-1
6917,Ses04M_impro01_M024,"Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.",0
6918,Ses04M_impro02_F000,It's the first year of your child's life.,-1
6919,Ses04M_impro02_F001,You're just fine with this?,-1
6920,Ses04M_impro02_F002,You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?,-1

6922,Ses04M_impro02_F004,Don't go.,-1
6923,Ses04M_impro02_F005,"Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.",-1
6924,Ses04M_impro02_F006,"You've made a pledge to us, too.  Remember that day, we stood in front of each other and said 'til death do us part.  Put on some rings and it's supposed to mean something.",-1
6925,Ses04M_impro02_F007,Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?,-1
6926,Ses04M_impro02_F008,"Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand",-1
6927,Ses04M_impro02_F009,You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,2
6928,Ses04M_impro02_F010,Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.,-1
6929,Ses04M_impro02_F011,"And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?",-1
6930,Ses04M_impro02_F012,Then why do you have to go a year at all?,-1
6931,Ses04M_impro02_F013,Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.,-1
6932,Ses04M_impro02_F014,This is supposed to be a partnership.  We're supposed to do this together. I'm not supposed to be left here to do this by myself while you leave.,-1
6933,Ses04M_impro02_F015,"What am I supposed to do, read your letters?",-1
6934,Ses04M_impro02_F016,"There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way.",-1
6935,Ses04M_impro02_F017,Just tell them no.,-1
6936,Ses04M_impro02_F018,"Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.",-1
6937,Ses04M_impro02_F019,Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?,-1
6938,Ses04M_impro02_F020,When do you leave?,2
6939,Ses04M_impro02_F021,A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,0
6940,Ses04M_impro02_F022,Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.,-1
6941,Ses04M_impro02_F023,"If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.",-1
6942,Ses04M_impro02_F024,"Fine, fine.  We have to be together.  If you can't stay here, then I'll go with you.  I don't care where you go.  We'll go, too.  I'm not staying behind.",-1
6943,Ses04M_impro02_F025,"It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.",-1
6944,Ses04M_impro02_F026,Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.,-1
6945,Ses04M_impro02_F027,"I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.",-1
6946,Ses04M_impro02_F028,You're not really giving me a lot of options.,-1
6947,Ses04M_impro02_F029,But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.,-1
6948,Ses04M_impro02_F030,I'm not going to stay here and wait.,-1

6955,Ses04M_impro02_M005,I can't do that.  I have to go.,-1
6956,Ses04M_impro02_M006,I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.,-1
6957,Ses04M_impro02_M007,I know that. I know that. I know that.,-1
6958,Ses04M_impro02_M008,"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.",3

7008,Ses04M_impro03_F022,She's going to let you have say in the wedding choices?  That's pretty impressive. Very forward-thinking woman. [LAUGHTER],-1
7009,Ses04M_impro03_F023,And brown.,-1

7013,Ses04M_impro03_M001,"Yeah. Yeah, I proposed to her yesterday. We're getting -- we're engaged now and we're going to -- we're going to get married in about eight months.",-1
7014,Ses04M_impro03_M002,"Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?",1
7015,Ses04M_impro03_M003,Well I decided to take her sailing,-1
7016,Ses04M_impro03_M004,"and we were just out on the water and, you know, I just -- I had the ring with me.  And I was like let's do this.  And she was like okay and then we're getting married.",-1
7017,Ses04M_impro03_M005,"Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.",1
7018,Ses04M_impro03_M006,"She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...",1
7019,Ses04M_impro03_M007,"Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.",1
7020,Ses04M_impro03_M008,"Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.",1
7021,Ses04M_impro03_M009,"But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of",1
7022,Ses04M_impro03_M010,"help Kate out with like planning stuff. I mean, if you want to.  I mean, you guys are good friends anyway so I figured, you know, if you guys want to like -- I mean, you know, I'm sure you enjoy that kind of thing.",-1
7023,Ses04M_impro03_M011,Okay. Well there you go.,1
7024,Ses04M_impro03_M012,I think we're going to -- we're going to -- we want to do it in Hawaii and just fly everybody in.,-1

7026,Ses04M_impro03_M014,"It's just going to be like a all fruit--fruit buffet wedding, plus a cake.",-1
7027,Ses04M_impro03_M015,Barefoot?,1
7028,Ses04M_impro03_M016,"Um, no, no, no.  It'll be in like a park near the beach.",-1
7029,Ses04M_impro03_M017,Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--,1
7030,Ses04M_impro03_M018,"It'll be kind of small, but not, you know, not tiny, you know.  I want to have, you know, as many people as we can afford to fly out to Hawaii and put up there for--",-1
7031,Ses04M_impro03_M019,It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--,1
7032,Ses04M_impro03_M020,"Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-",1
7033,Ses04M_impro03_M021,"Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-",1
7034,Ses04M_impro03_M022,"Yeah, yeah.",1
7035,Ses04M_impro03_M023,"Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.",1
7036,Ses04M_impro03_M024,"But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.",1
7037,Ses04M_impro03_M025,"And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.",1
7038,Ses04M_impro03_M026,She's okay with it.,1
7039,Ses04M_impro03_M027,"Exactly, exactly, exactly.  So--",-1
7040,Ses04M_impro03_M028,"Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.",1
7041,Ses04M_impro03_M029,All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,1
7042,Ses04M_impro03_M030,Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.,1
7043,Ses04M_impro03_M031,"So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--",3
7044,Ses04M_impro04_F000,Well there has to be something you haven't tried.,3
7045,Ses04M_impro04_F001,What about like a temp agency?,3
7046,Ses04M_impro04_F002,"Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.",3
7047,Ses04M_impro04_F003,"Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and",3
7048,Ses04M_impro04_F004,"I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.",3
7049,Ses04M_impro04_F005,"Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.",3
7050,Ses04M_impro04_F006,"Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.",3
7051,Ses04M_impro04_F007,"If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.",3
7052,Ses04M_impro04_F008,"Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.",3
7053,Ses04M_impro04_F009,"I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--",3
7054,Ses04M_impro04_F010,Excuse me?,-1
7055,Ses04M_impro04_F011,It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?,3
7056,Ses04M_impro04_F012,Well that sounds like your fault.,3
7057,Ses04M_impro04_F013,You didn't do what I told you to do.,3
7058,Ses04M_impro04_F014,That's amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault.,-1
7059,Ses04M_impro04_F015,I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.,3
7060,Ses04M_impro04_F016,Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?,3
7061,Ses04M_impro04_F017,[LAUGHTER],3
7062,Ses04M_impro04_F018,"You see what you just did there, though?",-1
7063,Ses04M_impro04_M000,"Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,",-1
7064,Ses04M_impro04_M001,"it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.",-1
7065,Ses04M_impro04_M002,"I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,",-1
7066,Ses04M_impro04_M003,"local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -",-1
7067,Ses04M_impro04_M004,"there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.",3
7068,Ses04M_impro04_M005,"Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on.",-1
7069,Ses04M_impro04_M006,"Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand.",-1
7070,Ses04M_impro04_M007,I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.,-1
7071,Ses04M_impro04_M008,"But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.",-1
7072,Ses04M_impro04_M009,"No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?",-1
7073,Ses04M_impro04_M010,I'm not choosing. I'm not-,-1
7074,Ses04M_impro04_M011,"No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them",-1
7075,Ses04M_impro04_M012,"-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.",-1
7076,Ses04M_impro04_M013,This is stupid.,-1
7077,Ses04M_impro04_M014,"You know what, this is your fault.",-1
7078,Ses04M_impro04_M015,It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--,-1
7079,Ses04M_impro04_M016,"Yeah, exactly.",-1
7080,Ses04M_impro04_M017,Yeah.,-1
7081,Ses04M_impro04_M018,That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because,-1
7082,Ses04M_impro04_M019,"-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.",-1
7083,Ses04M_impro04_M020,"Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?",3
7084,Ses04M_impro04_M021,That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.,3
7085,Ses04M_impro04_M022,Yours.  I don't--,3
7086,Ses04M_impro04_M023,"I had- No, I don't.  I'm sorry.  I just totally screwed this one up.  You can stop it I guess.",-1
7087,Ses04M_impro05_F000,"Hi, how can I help you?",3
7088,Ses04M_impro05_F001,Mmhmm.,3
7089,Ses04M_impro05_F002,I'm sorry.,3

7111,Ses04M_impro05_F024,No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.,-1
7112,Ses04M_impro05_F025,I can write you the one check.,-1
7113,Ses04M_impro05_F026,All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.,-1
7114,Ses04M_impro05_F027,"I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.",-1
7115,Ses04M_impro05_F028,We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.,-1
7116,Ses04M_impro05_F029,"No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.",-1
7117,Ses04M_impro05_F030,And your bag is not my concern.,-1
7118,Ses04M_impro05_F031,The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.,-1
7119,Ses04M_impro05_F032,I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.,-1
7120,Ses04M_impro05_F033,You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.,-1
7121,Ses04M_impro05_F034,Then that would be lying.,-1
7122,Ses04M_impro05_F035,I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.,-1
7123,Ses04M_impro05_F036,"I understand you're frustrated, but--",3
7124,Ses04M_impro05_F037,I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.,3

7128,Ses04M_impro05_F041,"I'm sorry, really.  But--",-1

7130,Ses04M_impro05_M000,"Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing.",-1
7131,Ses04M_impro05_M001,Just arrived from London--,-1
7132,Ses04M_impro05_M002,lost my luggage. Your airline--,-1
7133,Ses04M_impro05_M003,"lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.",-1
7134,Ses04M_impro05_M004,"It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.",-1
7135,Ses04M_impro05_M005,"Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure.",-1
7136,Ses04M_impro05_M006,"And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.",-1
7137,Ses04M_impro05_M007,'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.,-1
7138,Ses04M_impro05_M008,fifty dollars?,0
7139,Ses04M_impro05_M009,"fifty dollars. No way, no.",0
7140,Ses04M_impro05_M010,"I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.",0
7141,Ses04M_impro05_M011,You understand?,0
7142,Ses04M_impro05_M012,"What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --",-1
7143,Ses04M_impro05_M013,But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.,-1
7144,Ses04M_impro05_M014,"No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--",0
7145,Ses04M_impro05_M015,You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.,0
7146,Ses04M_impro05_M016,You--,0
7147,Ses04M_impro05_M017,No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.,0
7148,Ses04M_impro05_M018,"Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.",0
7149,Ses04M_impro05_M019,And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-,-1
7150,Ses04M_impro05_M020,"I'm going to get very upset.  Like, I mean, I'm- I'm upset right now but I'm going to get really upset if you- if you don't do the check thing.",-1
7151,Ses04M_impro05_M021,"You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay.",-1
7152,Ses04M_impro05_M022,"Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--",0
7153,Ses04M_impro05_M023,"No, it's not going to be -- but it's not going to be fifty, it's going to be a hundred and fifty.  You're going to write three, you understand, three of- of the forms.  You're going to write three of them out and then give it to me.",-1
7154,Ses04M_impro05_M024,You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.,-1
7155,Ses04M_impro05_M025,"Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,",-1
7156,Ses04M_impro05_M026,but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.,0
7157,Ses04M_impro05_M027,"But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--",-1
7158,Ses04M_impro05_M028,But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person,-1
7159,Ses04M_impro05_M029,then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?,-1
7160,Ses04M_impro05_M030,But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.,-1
7161,Ses04M_impro05_M031,"Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--",-1
7162,Ses04M_impro05_M032,So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms,-1
7163,Ses04M_impro05_M033,with different names on them? That-,-1
7164,Ses04M_impro05_M034,"but, no. See, 'cause",-1
7165,Ses04M_impro05_M035,if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.,-1
7166,Ses04M_impro05_M036,"Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but",-1
7167,Ses04M_impro05_M037,"um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.",-1
7168,Ses04M_impro05_M038,Please.,0
7169,Ses04M_impro05_M039,"I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.",0
7170,Ses04M_impro05_M040,"Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again.",-1
7171,Ses04M_impro05_M041,But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.,-1
7172,Ses04M_impro05_M042,But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.,-1
7173,Ses04M_impro05_M043,I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.,-1
7174,Ses04M_impro05_M044,"Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",0
7175,Ses04M_impro05_M045,"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",0
7176,Ses04M_impro06_F000,"Hey, how you doing?",2

7179,Ses04M_impro06_F003,I'm sorry.  It's never easy.,2
7180,Ses04M_impro06_F004,"But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --",2
7181,Ses04M_impro06_F005,--it doesn't really do anything.  But--,2

7379,Ses04M_script01_1_F018,What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,0
7380,Ses04M_script01_1_F019,Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,3
7381,Ses04M_script01_1_F020,I'm just saying.,-1
7382,Ses04M_script01_1_F021,I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,0
7383,Ses04M_script01_1_F022,"From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.",0
7384,Ses04M_script01_1_F023,"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.",-1
7385,Ses04M_script01_1_F024,Now what can I do for you?,-1
7386,Ses04M_script01_1_F025,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,-1
7387,Ses04M_script01_1_F026,Did you ask Annie yet?,-1
7388,Ses04M_script01_1_F027,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,3
7389,Ses04M_script01_1_F028,"The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.",3
7390,Ses04M_script01_1_F029,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,0
7391,Ses04M_script01_1_F030,"Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",-1
7392,Ses04M_script01_1_F031,"Alright, then, mom.",-1
7393,Ses04M_script01_1_F032,Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,3
7394,Ses04M_script01_1_F033,Just give it some more thought.,3
7395,Ses04M_script01_1_F034,What the hell is this?,0
7396,Ses04M_script01_1_F035,Are you crazy?,0
7397,Ses04M_script01_1_F036,You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,0
7398,Ses04M_script01_1_F037,Must you be inspired?,0
7399,Ses04M_script01_1_F038,You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?,-1
7400,Ses04M_script01_1_F039,You don't want to think like that.,0
7401,Ses04M_script01_1_F040,"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",0
7402,Ses04M_script01_1_F041,"But don't think that way, you hear me?",0
7403,Ses04M_script01_1_F042,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
7404,Ses04M_script01_1_F043,"Yeah, I can see that.",-1
7405,Ses04M_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,3
7406,Ses04M_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,3
7407,Ses04M_script01_1_M002,About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,-1
7408,Ses04M_script01_1_M003,"I don't know.  After it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.",-1
7409,Ses04M_script01_1_M004,No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.,-1
7410,Ses04M_script01_1_M005,I heard him right through the floor of my room.,-1
7411,Ses04M_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,-1
7412,Ses04M_script01_1_M007,"I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.",-1
7413,Ses04M_script01_1_M008,Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,-1
7414,Ses04M_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,-1
7415,Ses04M_script01_1_M010,I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.,-1
7416,Ses04M_script01_1_M011,Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him.,-1
7417,Ses04M_script01_1_M012,"Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.",-1
7418,Ses04M_script01_1_M013,We've gotta say it to him.,0
7419,Ses04M_script01_1_M014,"For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",0
7420,Ses04M_script01_1_M015,"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",-1
7421,Ses04M_script01_1_M016,"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",-1
7422,Ses04M_script01_1_M017,You know why.,-1
7423,Ses04M_script01_1_M018,Going to ask her to marry me.,3
7424,Ses04M_script01_1_M019,You know it's not only my business.,-1
7425,Ses04M_script01_1_M020,Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?,-1
7426,Ses04M_script01_1_M021,"Well, then you know it's not only my business.",0
7427,Ses04M_script01_1_M022,"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",0
7428,Ses04M_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl.,-1
7429,Ses04M_script01_1_M024,"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",-1
7430,Ses04M_script01_1_M025,To hell with that.,-1
7431,Ses04M_script01_1_M026,I wanted to get this settled first.,3
7432,Ses04M_script01_1_M027,"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",-1
7433,Ses04M_script01_1_M028,So what?  I'm not fast with women.,-1
7434,Ses04M_script01_1_M029,Because it is.,-1
7435,Ses04M_script01_1_M030,Line?,-1
7436,Ses04M_script01_1_M031,"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",3
7437,Ses04M_script01_1_M032,"Yeah, let's keep going.",3
7438,Ses04M_script01_1_M033,I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,-1
7439,Ses04M_script01_1_M034,"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",2
7440,Ses04M_script01_1_M035,I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.,-1
7441,Ses04M_script01_1_M036,I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.,-1
7442,Ses04M_script01_1_M037,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0
7443,Ses04M_script01_1_M038,"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",0
7444,Ses04M_script01_1_M039,I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,-1
7445,Ses04M_script01_1_M040,"Yes, on this I would.",3
7446,Ses04M_script01_1_M041,Then you help me stay here.,3
7447,Ses04M_script01_1_M042,I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,-1
7448,Ses04M_script01_1_M043,I am thinking that way.,-1
7449,Ses04M_script01_1_M044,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",-1
7450,Ses04M_script01_2_F000,Why did he invite her here?,0
7451,Ses04M_script01_2_F001,Why does that bother you?,3
7452,Ses04M_script01_2_F002,"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",0
7453,Ses04M_script01_2_F003,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,0
7454,Ses04M_script01_2_F004,He's not going to marry her.,0
7455,Ses04M_script01_2_F005,It's got that about it.,0
7456,Ses04M_script01_2_F006,"What's going on here, Joe?",0
7457,Ses04M_script01_2_F007,"Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",3
7458,Ses04M_script01_2_F008,"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",0
7459,Ses04M_script01_2_F009,"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",0
7460,Ses04M_script01_2_F010,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",0
7461,Ses04M_script01_2_F011,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",0
7462,Ses04M_script01_2_F012,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",0
7463,Ses04M_script01_2_F013,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",0
7464,Ses04M_script01_2_F014,Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,0
7465,Ses04M_script01_2_F015,She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,0
7466,Ses04M_script01_2_F016,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",0
7467,Ses04M_script01_2_F017,"Only last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.",-1
7468,Ses04M_script01_2_F018,"You, above all, have got to believe.  You.",0
7469,Ses04M_script01_2_F019,Just don't stop believing.,-1
7470,Ses04M_script01_2_F020,I can't help it.,2
7471,Ses04M_script01_2_M000,"Oh, God, line.",3
7472,Ses04M_script01_2_M001,"Why does- why, does that bother you?",-1
7473,Ses04M_script01_2_M002,"Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.",-1
7474,Ses04M_script01_2_M003,What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?,-1
7475,Ses04M_script01_2_M004,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,-1
7476,Ses04M_script01_2_M005,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,3
7477,Ses04M_script01_2_M006,Well so what?,3
7478,Ses04M_script01_2_M007,Line.,3
7479,Ses04M_script01_2_M008,"Oh.  Now listen, kid.",-1
7480,Ses04M_script01_2_M009,You can't read her mind.,-1
7481,Ses04M_script01_2_M010,How do you know why she waited?,-1
7482,Ses04M_script01_2_M011,"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",-1
7483,Ses04M_script01_2_M012,What do you want me to do? What do you want?,-1
7484,Ses04M_script01_2_M013,"But, Kate--",-1
7485,Ses04M_script01_2_M014,Calm yourself.,-1
7486,Ses04M_script01_2_M015,Calm yourself.,-1
7487,Ses04M_script01_2_M016,"Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.",-1
7488,Ses04M_script01_2_M017,Why me above all?,-1
7489,Ses04M_script01_2_M018,"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.",-1
7490,Ses04M_script01_2_M019,"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",0
7491,Ses04M_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,-1
7492,Ses04M_script01_3_F001,"It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet.",-1
7493,Ses04M_script01_3_F002,"No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",-1
7494,Ses04M_script01_3_F003,"In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",-1
7495,Ses04M_script01_3_F004,You saw that and then you've been kind of--,-1
7496,Ses04M_script01_3_F005,"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",-1
7497,Ses04M_script01_3_F006,"I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",-1
7498,Ses04M_script01_3_F007,"From her point of view, why else would I come?",-1
7499,Ses04M_script01_3_F008,I guess this is why I came.,-1
7500,Ses04M_script01_3_F009,"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",-1
7501,Ses04M_script01_3_F010,I almost got married two years ago.,-1
7502,Ses04M_script01_3_F011,You started to write me.,-1
7503,Ses04M_script01_3_F012,Every day since.,1
7504,Ses04M_script01_3_F013,"I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.",1
7505,Ses04M_script01_3_F014,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,1
7506,Ses04M_script01_3_F015,Not like that you're not.,-1
7507,Ses04M_script01_3_F016,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?",-1
7508,Ses04M_script01_3_F017,"No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",-1
7509,Ses04M_script01_3_F018,"Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",-1
7510,Ses04M_script01_3_F019,You've got to tell me.,-1
7511,Ses04M_script01_3_F020,It wouldn't work this way.,-1
7512,Ses04M_script01_3_F021,"Yeah, sure.",-1
7513,Ses04M_script01_3_F022,How many?,2
7514,Ses04M_script01_3_F023,"Oh, gees.",2
7515,Ses04M_script01_3_F024,And do you still feel that way?,-1
7516,Ses04M_script01_3_F025,"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.",-1
7517,Ses04M_script01_3_F026,"And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",-1
7518,Ses04M_script01_3_F027,What'll I do with a fortune?,1
7519,Ses04M_script01_3_M000,"I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?",-1
7520,Ses04M_script01_3_M001,So you're not sorry you came?,-1
7521,Ses04M_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
7522,Ses04M_script01_3_M003,What?,-1
7523,Ses04M_script01_3_M004,The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.,-1
7524,Ses04M_script01_3_M005,How did you know?,-1
7525,Ses04M_script01_3_M006,Well wouldn't you want to?,-1
7526,Ses04M_script01_3_M007,I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,-1
7527,Ses04M_script01_3_M008,"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",-1
7528,Ses04M_script01_3_M009,I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,-1
7529,Ses04M_script01_3_M010,I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.,-1
7530,Ses04M_script01_3_M011,"You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",-1
7531,Ses04M_script01_3_M012,Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?,-1
7532,Ses04M_script01_3_M013,Why didn't you?,-1
7533,Ses04M_script01_3_M014,You felt something that far back?,-1
7534,Ses04M_script01_3_M015,"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",-1
7535,Ses04M_script01_3_M016,"Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -",-1
7536,Ses04M_script01_3_M017,"I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.",-1
7537,Ses04M_script01_3_M018,"Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",-1
7538,Ses04M_script01_3_M019,I kissed you.,-1
7539,Ses04M_script01_3_M020,Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.,-1
7540,Ses04M_script01_3_M021,"No, no, nothing like that.",-1
7541,Ses04M_script01_3_M022,"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",2
7542,Ses04M_script01_3_M023,I don't know where to start.,2
7543,Ses04M_script01_3_M024,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",2
7544,Ses04M_script01_3_M025,Well I lost them.,2
7545,Ses04M_script01_3_M026,Just about all.,2
7546,Ses04M_script01_3_M027,It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,2
7547,Ses04M_script01_3_M028,"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",2
7548,Ses04M_script01_3_M029,They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,-1
7549,Ses04M_script01_3_M030,"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",2
7550,Ses04M_script01_3_M031,a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,2
7551,Ses04M_script01_3_M032,"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",2
7552,Ses04M_script01_3_M033,because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,2
7553,Ses04M_script01_3_M034,"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",2
7554,Ses04M_script01_3_M035,"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",2
7555,Ses04M_script01_3_M036,"I want you now, Annie.",-1
7556,Ses04M_script01_3_M037,"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",1
7557,Ses04M_script02_1_F000,Fine.,3
7558,Ses04M_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,-1
7559,Ses04M_script02_1_F002,It's not yours.,0
7560,Ses04M_script02_1_F003,"It's ours.  It's mine, too.",0
7561,Ses04M_script02_1_F004,You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,0
7562,Ses04M_script02_1_F005,Yes.,0
7563,Ses04M_script02_1_F006,I'm cold.,-1
7564,Ses04M_script02_1_F007,It's after eleven; let's go home.,0
7565,Ses04M_script02_1_F008,There is no point in coming down here.,0
7566,Ses04M_script02_1_F009,That's my point.,-1
7567,Ses04M_script02_1_F010,So let's go home.,0
7568,Ses04M_script02_1_F011,Not particularly.,-1
7569,Ses04M_script02_1_F012,I just don't.  It's stupid.,0
7570,Ses04M_script02_1_F013,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",0
7571,Ses04M_script02_1_F014,What are you so excited about?,3
7572,Ses04M_script02_1_F015,This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,-1
7573,Ses04M_script02_1_F016,I'm just not.,-1
7574,Ses04M_script02_1_F017,Yes.,0
7575,Ses04M_script02_1_F018,"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",0
7576,Ses04M_script02_1_F019,We didn't see them the first time either.,-1
7577,Ses04M_script02_1_F020,That's the wind.,-1
7578,Ses04M_script02_1_F021,About what?,-1
7579,Ses04M_script02_1_M000,"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.",-1
7580,Ses04M_script02_1_M001,"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?",1
7581,Ses04M_script02_1_M002,"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",1
7582,Ses04M_script02_1_M003,"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",1
7583,Ses04M_script02_1_M004,"The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",-1
7584,Ses04M_script02_1_M005,Whose is it?,3
7585,Ses04M_script02_1_M006,"Well, sure.",-1
7586,Ses04M_script02_1_M007,"No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.",-1
7587,Ses04M_script02_1_M008,"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?",1
7588,Ses04M_script02_1_M009,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",3
7589,Ses04M_script02_1_M010,"Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.",-1
7590,Ses04M_script02_1_M011,I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,-1
7591,Ses04M_script02_1_M012,You want my jacket?,3
7592,Ses04M_script02_1_M013,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,-1
7593,Ses04M_script02_1_M014,Right.,3
7594,Ses04M_script02_1_M015,"That's my point, too.",3
7595,Ses04M_script02_1_M016,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",-1
7596,Ses04M_script02_1_M017,Why not?,-1
7597,Ses04M_script02_1_M018,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",1
7598,Ses04M_script02_1_M019,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.",-1
7599,Ses04M_script02_1_M020,There's mystery here and magic.,1
7600,Ses04M_script02_1_M021,"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",1
7601,Ses04M_script02_1_M022,"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",1
7602,Ses04M_script02_1_M023,There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,1
7603,Ses04M_script02_1_M024,For real?,-1
7604,Ses04M_script02_1_M025,"I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.",-1
7605,Ses04M_script02_1_M026,We weren't in a good spot.,-1
7606,Ses04M_script02_1_M027,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -,-1
7607,Ses04M_script02_1_M028,"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",1
7608,Ses04M_script02_1_M029,Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,1
7609,Ses04M_script02_1_M030,"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",1
7610,Ses04M_script02_1_M031,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,1
7611,Ses04M_script02_1_M032,"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",1
7612,Ses04M_script02_1_M033,Well so what did you think?,1
7613,Ses04M_script02_2_F000,"Look at this, goose bumps.",3
7614,Ses04M_script02_2_F001,About what?,-1
7615,Ses04M_script02_2_F002,It's ridiculous.,-1
7616,Ses04M_script02_2_F003,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,-1
7617,Ses04M_script02_2_F004,Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,-1
7618,Ses04M_script02_2_F005,"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",-1
7619,Ses04M_script02_2_F006,"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",0
7620,Ses04M_script02_2_F007,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,0
7621,Ses04M_script02_2_F008,"For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.",-1
7622,Ses04M_script02_2_F009,"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",0
7623,Ses04M_script02_2_F010,Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,-1
7624,Ses04M_script02_2_F011,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",-1
7625,Ses04M_script02_2_F012,You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,-1
7626,Ses04M_script02_2_F013,"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",0
7627,Ses04M_script02_2_F014,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",-1
7628,Ses04M_script02_2_F015,Do you remember the first time we came to see it?,-1
7629,Ses04M_script02_2_F016,"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",2
7630,Ses04M_script02_2_F017,"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",-1
7631,Ses04M_script02_2_F018,Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,2
7632,Ses04M_script02_2_F019,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,2
7633,Ses04M_script02_2_F020,No.,2
7634,Ses04M_script02_2_F021,No.,2
7635,Ses04M_script02_2_F022,No.,-1
7636,Ses04M_script02_2_F023,No.,-1
7637,Ses04M_script02_2_F024,No.,-1
7638,Ses04M_script02_2_F025,No.,0
7639,Ses04M_script02_2_F026,I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,0
7640,Ses04M_script02_2_F027,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,0
7641,Ses04M_script02_2_F028,"Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.",0
7642,Ses04M_script02_2_F029,But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,0
7643,Ses04M_script02_2_F030,"This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",-1
7644,Ses04M_script02_2_F031,"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",-1
7645,Ses04M_script02_2_F032,I didn't say that.,2
7646,Ses04M_script02_2_F033,"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",-1
7647,Ses04M_script02_2_F034,Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,-1
7648,Ses04M_script02_2_F035,"Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",1
7649,Ses04M_script02_2_F036,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.",1
7650,Ses04M_script02_2_F037,Or not.,-1
7651,Ses04M_script02_2_M000,Well so what'd you think?,3
7652,Ses04M_script02_2_M001,What I said.,3
7653,Ses04M_script02_2_M002,Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,-1
7654,Ses04M_script02_2_M003,I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,-1
7655,Ses04M_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
7656,Ses04M_script02_2_M005,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",-1
7657,Ses04M_script02_2_M006,Well what's bugging you?,0
7658,Ses04M_script02_2_M007,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",0
7659,Ses04M_script02_2_M008,Why not?,-1
7660,Ses04M_script02_2_M009,We've missed them twice.,-1
7661,Ses04M_script02_2_M010,That's not ever.,-1
7662,Ses04M_script02_2_M011,We'll see them this year.,-1
7663,Ses04M_script02_2_M012,I thought you wanted to see them.,-1
7664,Ses04M_script02_2_M013,"No, of course, not.",-1
7665,Ses04M_script02_2_M014,It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,-1
7666,Ses04M_script02_2_M015,"I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.",-1
7667,Ses04M_script02_2_M016,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.",-1
7668,Ses04M_script02_2_M017,"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",-1
7669,Ses04M_script02_2_M018,"uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.",-1
7670,Ses04M_script02_2_M019,Uh.,-1
7671,Ses04M_script02_2_M020,"Wait a minute, I've got it.",3
7672,Ses04M_script02_2_M021,"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",3
7673,Ses04M_script02_2_M022,Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?,-1
7674,Ses04M_script02_2_M023,You want to get some champagne?,-1
7675,Ses04M_script02_2_M024,"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",-1
7676,Ses04M_script02_2_M025,You want to get married again?,-1
7677,Ses04M_script02_2_M026,"What, you want a divorce?",-1
7678,Ses04M_script02_2_M027,A vacation?,-1
7679,Ses04M_script02_2_M028,"A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want?",-1
7680,Ses04M_script02_2_M029,"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",0
7681,Ses04M_script02_2_M030,"No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.",-1
7682,Ses04M_script02_2_M031,"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",0
7683,Ses04M_script02_2_M032,"Yes, it is.",-1
7684,Ses04M_script02_2_M033,Right.,-1
7685,Ses04M_script02_2_M034,"No, I know, me neither.",0
7686,Ses04M_script02_2_M035,I'm doing the best I can.,-1
7687,Ses04M_script02_2_M036,"Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?",-1
7688,Ses04M_script02_2_M037,"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",2
7689,Ses04M_script02_2_M038,Yeah?,-1
7690,Ses04M_script02_2_M039,"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",1
7691,Ses04M_script02_2_M040,"I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.",1
7692,Ses04M_script02_2_M041,"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",1
7693,Ses04M_script02_2_M042,Or not.,-1
7694,Ses04M_script03_1_F000,Do you think it's them?,-1
7695,Ses04M_script03_1_F001,"Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",-1
7696,Ses04M_script03_1_F002,What are we to do?,-1
7697,Ses04M_script03_1_F003,Now and always sweet.,-1
7698,Ses04M_script03_1_F004,It was bound to come sooner or later.,-1
7699,Ses04M_script03_1_F005,"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",1
7700,Ses04M_script03_1_F006,Behave exquisitely.,1
7701,Ses04M_script03_1_F007,Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.,1
7702,Ses04M_script03_1_F008,But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,1
7703,Ses04M_script03_1_F009,It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.,1
7704,Ses04M_script03_1_F010,"Yes, meaning just that.",-1
7705,Ses04M_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,-1
7706,Ses04M_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,1
7707,Ses04M_script03_1_F013,"If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",3
7708,Ses04M_script03_1_F014,"How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?",1
7709,Ses04M_script03_1_F015,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,1
7710,Ses04M_script03_1_F016,"Oh, dear.  Should we like that.",-1
7711,Ses04M_script03_1_F017,"What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?",1
7712,Ses04M_script03_1_F018,"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",1
7713,Ses04M_script03_1_F019,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",-1
7714,Ses04M_script03_1_F020,"Elliot, worms don't pop.",-1
7715,Ses04M_script03_1_F021,"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.",1
7716,Ses04M_script03_1_F022,Which particular one?,1
7717,Ses04M_script03_1_F023,"Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.",1
7718,Ses04M_script03_1_F024,I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,1
7719,Ses04M_script03_1_F025,It went on intermittently for days.,1
7720,Ses04M_script03_1_F026,"It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.",1
7721,Ses04M_script03_1_F027,That was the first time you ever hit me.,1
7722,Ses04M_script03_1_F028,"The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.",1
7723,Ses04M_script03_1_F029,"How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",1
7724,Ses04M_script03_1_F030,And very much sillier.,1
7725,Ses04M_script03_1_M000,Good God.,-1
7726,Ses04M_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,-1
7727,Ses04M_script03_1_M002,"It must be them, then.",-1
7728,Ses04M_script03_1_M003,"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",3
7729,Ses04M_script03_1_M004,"I don't care, then.",1
7730,Ses04M_script03_1_M005,"Hello, hello.  What?  Wrong number.",-1
7731,Ses04M_script03_1_M006,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,1
7732,Ses04M_script03_1_M007,With the mo- with the most perfect poise?,1
7733,Ses04M_script03_1_M008,"Ah.  Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter when one's happy, do they?",-1
7734,Ses04M_script03_1_M009,"Don't say that, darling.",-1
7735,Ses04M_script03_1_M010,"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",3
7736,Ses04M_script03_1_M011,"What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",-1
7737,Ses04M_script03_1_M012,"You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.",3
7738,Ses04M_script03_1_M013,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,0
7739,Ses04M_script03_1_M014,Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.,-1
7740,Ses04M_script03_1_M015,Who knows.,-1
7741,Ses04M_script03_1_M016,No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,2
7742,Ses04M_script03_1_M017,It all depends on how well we've played.,-1
7743,Ses04M_script03_1_M018,"Yes.  Yes, with all his might.",-1
7744,Ses04M_script03_1_M019,"No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.",-1
7745,Ses04M_script03_1_M020,"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.",-1
7746,Ses04M_script03_1_M021,"Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",1
7747,Ses04M_script03_1_M022,"I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.",-1

You know, I don't-maybe I have a job and yeah, it's a good job whatever and I'm happy, but it doesn't mean I'm going to have it tomorrow or the next day.  You never know what's going to happen.  Something crazy could happen tomorrow.	Something crazy can happen for you tomorrow and you'll get a job.  You never know.  You can walk up to somebody on the street and it'll be something great.  You've just got to be positive.  You're so negative all the time.",-1
8195,Ses05F_impro04_M019,"I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.",-1
8196,Ses05F_impro04_M020,"It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-",3
8197,Ses05F_impro04_M021,"But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.",-1

8199,Ses05F_impro04_M023,You can.,-1
8200,Ses05F_impro04_M024,You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.,3

8211,Ses05F_impro04_M035,Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?,3
8212,Ses05F_impro04_M036,Of course.,3
8213,Ses05F_impro04_M037,"Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.",3
8214,Ses05F_impro04_M038,So what's the something else?,3
8215,Ses05F_impro04_M039,"You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.",3
8216,Ses05F_impro04_M040,If I- If you- Will you stick with it?,3
8217,Ses05F_impro04_M041,"Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.",3
8218,Ses05F_impro04_M042,"But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?",3
8219,Ses05F_impro04_M043,You know I'll always help you.,3
8220,Ses05F_impro05_F000,"Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.",3

8224,Ses05F_impro05_F004,Right.,3
8225,Ses05F_impro05_F005,Yeah.,3
8226,Ses05F_impro05_F006,That's good.,3
8227,Ses05F_impro05_F007,"Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?",3
8228,Ses05F_impro05_F008,"Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?",-1
8229,Ses05F_impro05_F009,"Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.",-1
8230,Ses05F_impro05_F010,Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.,3
8231,Ses05F_impro05_F011,"No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.",-1
8232,Ses05F_impro05_F012,I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--,-1
8233,Ses05F_impro05_F013,Okay.,-1
8234,Ses05F_impro05_F014,"Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--",-1
8235,Ses05F_impro05_F015,--really important stuff.,-1
8236,Ses05F_impro05_F016,"That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back.",-1
8237,Ses05F_impro05_F017,Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?,-1
8238,Ses05F_impro05_F018,Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.,0
8239,Ses05F_impro05_F019,"No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",0
8240,Ses05F_impro05_F020,"Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.",0
8241,Ses05F_impro05_F021,"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",0
8242,Ses05F_impro05_F022,"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",0
8243,Ses05F_impro05_F023,And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,0
8244,Ses05F_impro05_F024,"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",0
8245,Ses05F_impro05_F025,No.,-1
8246,Ses05F_impro05_F026,Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,-1
8247,Ses05F_impro05_F027,"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",-1
8248,Ses05F_impro05_F028,Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,-1
8249,Ses05F_impro05_F029,"So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.",-1
8250,Ses05F_impro05_F030,There's nothing else you can do?,-1
8251,Ses05F_impro05_F031,I don't believe that for a second.,0
8252,Ses05F_impro05_F032,"No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",-1
8253,Ses05F_impro05_F033,What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,0
8254,Ses05F_impro05_F034,You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,0
8255,Ses05F_impro05_F035,You could go into the computer and- you know- print-,-1
8256,Ses05F_impro05_F036,"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",-1
8257,Ses05F_impro05_F037,And you have no guarantee.,-1
8258,Ses05F_impro05_F038,This is ridiculous.,-1
8259,Ses05F_impro05_F039,"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",-1
8260,Ses05F_impro05_F040,"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",-1
8261,Ses05F_impro05_F041,"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",0
8262,Ses05F_impro05_F042,It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,0
8263,Ses05F_impro05_F043,okay fine.,-1
8264,Ses05F_impro05_F044,"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.",-1
8265,Ses05F_impro05_F045,Thanks.,-1
8266,Ses05F_impro05_M000,"Okay, what flight were you on?",3
8267,Ses05F_impro05_M001,On what airline?,3
8268,Ses05F_impro05_M002,"From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?",3
8269,Ses05F_impro05_M003,So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.,3
8270,Ses05F_impro05_M004,"Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-",3
8271,Ses05F_impro05_M005,It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-,3
8272,Ses05F_impro05_M006,But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh,3
8273,Ses05F_impro05_M007,I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.,3
8274,Ses05F_impro05_M008,"Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.",3
8275,Ses05F_impro05_M009,"Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?",3
8276,Ses05F_impro05_M010,"Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?",3
8277,Ses05F_impro05_M011,And you couldn't find it?,-1
8278,Ses05F_impro05_M012,Are you sure?,3
8279,Ses05F_impro05_M013,"Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.",-1
8280,Ses05F_impro05_M014,"All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?",3
8281,Ses05F_impro05_M015,Sentimental value.,3
8282,Ses05F_impro05_M016,"Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.",3
8283,Ses05F_impro05_M017,"No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.",3
8284,Ses05F_impro05_M018,"Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?",3
8285,Ses05F_impro05_M019,"Well,",3
8286,Ses05F_impro05_M020,Obviously ma'am.,-1
8287,Ses05F_impro05_M021,"I am sorry, ma'am.",-1
8288,Ses05F_impro05_M022,"Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.",3
8289,Ses05F_impro05_M023,"Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?",3
8290,Ses05F_impro05_M024,"Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?",-1
8291,Ses05F_impro05_M025,"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",3
8292,Ses05F_impro05_M026,That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,-1
8293,Ses05F_impro05_M027,"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",-1
8294,Ses05F_impro05_M028,"Right. Yes, ma'am.",-1
8295,Ses05F_impro05_M029,"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",-1
8296,Ses05F_impro05_M030,"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",3
8297,Ses05F_impro05_M031,"Well, my hands are really tied then.",3
8298,Ses05F_impro05_M032,"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",3
8299,Ses05F_impro05_M033,"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",3
8300,Ses05F_impro05_M034,"Uh, so it was really heavy.",3
8301,Ses05F_impro05_M035,"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",-1
8302,Ses05F_impro05_M036,"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",3
8303,Ses05F_impro05_M037,Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,3
8304,Ses05F_impro05_M038,"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",-1
8305,Ses05F_impro05_M039,"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",3
8306,Ses05F_impro05_M040,makes up?,3
8307,Ses05F_impro05_M041,"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",3
8308,Ses05F_impro05_M042,I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.,-1
8309,Ses05F_impro05_M043,"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",-1
8310,Ses05F_impro05_M044,"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",-1
8311,Ses05F_impro05_M045,How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,-1
8312,Ses05F_impro05_M046,"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",-1
8313,Ses05F_impro05_M047,"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",-1
8314,Ses05F_impro05_M048,Right.,3
8315,Ses05F_impro05_M049,"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",-1
8316,Ses05F_impro05_M050,"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",3
8317,Ses05F_impro05_M051,So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?,3
8318,Ses05F_impro05_M052,"Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.",3
8319,Ses05F_impro05_M053,You have a wonderful day.,3
8320,Ses05F_impro06_F000,A good friend of mine passed away the other day.,2
8321,Ses05F_impro06_F001,"Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,",2
8322,Ses05F_impro06_F002,"metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-",2
8323,Ses05F_impro06_F003,Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.,2
8324,Ses05F_impro06_F004,[BREATHING],2
8325,Ses05F_impro06_F005,Kind of.,2
8326,Ses05F_impro06_F006,"It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.",2
8327,Ses05F_impro06_F007,"I just, I don't know.",2
8328,Ses05F_impro06_F008,I know.,2

8330,Ses05F_impro06_F010,"Uh,  We grew up together.",2
8331,Ses05F_impro06_F011,"Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.",2
8332,Ses05F_impro06_F012,"I feel really bad for his family, you know.",2
8333,Ses05F_impro06_F013,"It must be really, really hard to lose a child.",2
8334,Ses05F_impro06_F014,"Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-",2
8335,Ses05F_impro06_F015,[BREATHING],2
8336,Ses05F_impro06_F016,I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.,2

8341,Ses05F_impro06_F021,"It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...",2
8342,Ses05F_impro06_F022,something happens and they die and it's like-,2
8343,Ses05F_impro06_F023,"really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.",2
8344,Ses05F_impro06_F024,[BREATHING],2
8345,Ses05F_impro06_F025,yeah.,2

8356,Ses05F_impro06_M006,It's the think,2
8357,Ses05F_impro06_M007,There's no reason for it.,2
8358,Ses05F_impro06_M008,Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?,2
8359,Ses05F_impro06_M009,yeah.,2

8522,Ses05F_script01_1_F002,When?,-1
8523,Ses05F_script01_1_F003,What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,-1
8524,Ses05F_script01_1_F004,Did you talk to him?,2
8525,Ses05F_script01_1_F005,He cried hard.,2
8526,Ses05F_script01_1_F006,He is thinking about him again.,2
8527,Ses05F_script01_1_F007,"It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.",2
8528,Ses05F_script01_1_F008,What's the meaning of that?,2
8529,Ses05F_script01_1_F009,What?,-1
8530,Ses05F_script01_1_F010,"What do you mean, dishonest?",-1
8531,Ses05F_script01_1_F011,"What are you going to do, argue with him?",-1
8532,Ses05F_script01_1_F012,You can't just say that to him.,-1
8533,Ses05F_script01_1_F013,"How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?",-1
8534,Ses05F_script01_1_F014,"To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?",-1
8535,Ses05F_script01_1_F015,"The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--",-1
8536,Ses05F_script01_1_F016,why?,-1
8537,Ses05F_script01_1_F017,Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?,3
8538,Ses05F_script01_1_F018,"Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.",-1
8539,Ses05F_script01_1_F019,"What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?",-1
8540,Ses05F_script01_1_F020,Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them,-1
8541,Ses05F_script01_1_F021,I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,-1
8542,Ses05F_script01_1_F022,"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.",-1
8543,Ses05F_script01_1_F023,"Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.",-1
8544,Ses05F_script01_1_F024,"Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",3
8545,Ses05F_script01_1_F025,Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,3
8546,Ses05F_script01_1_F026,"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",3
8547,Ses05F_script01_1_F027,"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",3
8548,Ses05F_script01_1_F028,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,3
8549,Ses05F_script01_1_F029,"well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.",-1
8550,Ses05F_script01_1_F030,"No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",-1
8551,Ses05F_script01_1_F031,"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",2
8552,Ses05F_script01_1_F032,Give it some more thought.,-1
8553,Ses05F_script01_1_F033,What the hell is this?,0
8554,Ses05F_script01_1_F034,Are you crazy?,0
8555,Ses05F_script01_1_F035,Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?,-1
8556,Ses05F_script01_1_F036,Must you be inspired?,-1
8557,Ses05F_script01_1_F037,"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",-1
8558,Ses05F_script01_1_F038,"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",0
8559,Ses05F_script01_1_F039,"All right, but don't think like that.",-1
8560,Ses05F_script01_1_F040,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
8561,Ses05F_script01_1_F041,"Yeah, I can see that.",-1
8562,Ses05F_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,2
8563,Ses05F_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,2
8564,Ses05F_script01_1_M002,"Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.",2
8565,Ses05F_script01_1_M003,I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.,2
8566,Ses05F_script01_1_M004,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,2
8567,Ses05F_script01_1_M005,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,2
8568,Ses05F_script01_1_M006,"I guess, he is.",2
8569,Ses05F_script01_1_M007,I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,2
8570,Ses05F_script01_1_M008,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,2
8571,Ses05F_script01_1_M009,"You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?",2
8572,Ses05F_script01_1_M010,"No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",-1
8573,Ses05F_script01_1_M011,"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",-1
8574,Ses05F_script01_1_M012,We have to say it to him!,-1
8575,Ses05F_script01_1_M013,"For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!",0
8576,Ses05F_script01_1_M014,"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",-1
8577,Ses05F_script01_1_M015,"All right, All right mom.  Listen!",-1
8578,Ses05F_script01_1_M016,"You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?",2
8579,Ses05F_script01_1_M017,You know.,-1
8580,Ses05F_script01_1_M018,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,3
8581,Ses05F_script01_1_M019,You know that's not just my business.,-1
8582,Ses05F_script01_1_M020,So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,-1
8583,Ses05F_script01_1_M021,Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?,-1
8584,Ses05F_script01_1_M022,"You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!",-1
8585,Ses05F_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl!,-1
8586,Ses05F_script01_1_M024,"I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",-1
8587,Ses05F_script01_1_M025,To hell with that!,0
8588,Ses05F_script01_1_M026,I want to get this settled first.,-1
8589,Ses05F_script01_1_M027,"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",-1
8590,Ses05F_script01_1_M028,"So what, I'm not fast with women.",-1
8591,Ses05F_script01_1_M029,Because it is.,-1
8592,Ses05F_script01_1_M030,"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",-1
8593,Ses05F_script01_1_M031,"All right, then, Mom.",-1
8594,Ses05F_script01_1_M032,"I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",-1
8595,Ses05F_script01_1_M033,"I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",-1
8596,Ses05F_script01_1_M034,"I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.",-1
8597,Ses05F_script01_1_M035,The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?,0
8598,Ses05F_script01_1_M036,"Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",-1
8599,Ses05F_script01_1_M037,Then help me stay here.,-1
8600,Ses05F_script01_1_M038,I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,-1
8601,Ses05F_script01_1_M039,I am thinking like that.,-1
8602,Ses05F_script01_1_M040,No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,-1
8603,Ses05F_script01_2_F000,Why did you invite her here?,-1
8604,Ses05F_script01_2_F001,She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,3
8605,Ses05F_script01_2_F002,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,-1
8606,Ses05F_script01_2_F003,He's not going to marry her.,-1
8607,Ses05F_script01_2_F004,It's got that about it.,-1
8608,Ses05F_script01_2_F005,"What's going on here, Joe?",-1
8609,Ses05F_script01_2_F006,She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,0
8610,Ses05F_script01_2_F007,"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",-1
8611,Ses05F_script01_2_F008,Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,-1
8612,Ses05F_script01_2_F009,"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",-1
8613,Ses05F_script01_2_F010,I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,0
8614,Ses05F_script01_2_F011,"Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.",0
8615,Ses05F_script01_2_F012,"Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",0
8616,Ses05F_script01_2_F013,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",-1
8617,Ses05F_script01_2_F014,"Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",0
8618,Ses05F_script01_2_F015,"You above all, have got to believe, Joe.",-1
8619,Ses05F_script01_2_F016,You've got to believe. You've got to--,2
8620,Ses05F_script01_2_F017,I can't help it!,0
8621,Ses05F_script01_2_M000,Why does that bother you?,3
8622,Ses05F_script01_2_M001,Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,3
8623,Ses05F_script01_2_M002,"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",3
8624,Ses05F_script01_2_M003,How do you know he is even thinking about it?,-1
8625,Ses05F_script01_2_M004,"Well, so what.",-1
8626,Ses05F_script01_2_M005,"Now, listen, Kate, just-",-1
8627,Ses05F_script01_2_M006,You can't read her mind.,-1
8628,Ses05F_script01_2_M007,How do you know why she's waited?,-1
8629,Ses05F_script01_2_M008,Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,-1
8630,Ses05F_script01_2_M009,What do you want me to do? What do you want--,-1
8631,Ses05F_script01_2_M010,"But, Kate...",-1
8632,Ses05F_script01_2_M011,[LAUGHTER],-1
8633,Ses05F_script01_2_M012,Calm yourself.,-1
8634,Ses05F_script01_2_M013,Calm yourself!,-1
8635,Ses05F_script01_2_M014,"All right, all right.  Calm yourself.",-1
8636,Ses05F_script01_2_M015,"Why me, above all?",-1
8637,Ses05F_script01_2_M016,What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!,0
8638,Ses05F_script01_2_M017,"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",0
8639,Ses05F_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,1
8640,Ses05F_script01_3_F001,"No, it's good.",1
8641,Ses05F_script01_3_F002,It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.,1
8642,Ses05F_script01_3_F003,No.  But I'm not going to stay.,1
8643,Ses05F_script01_3_F004,Well your mother has much as told me to leave.,-1
8644,Ses05F_script01_3_F005,"Well, you saw that! And you.  You've been-",-1
8645,Ses05F_script01_3_F006,Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,2
8646,Ses05F_script01_3_F007,I figured they would- your mother at least.,-1
8647,Ses05F_script01_3_F008,"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",3
8648,Ses05F_script01_3_F009,I guess this is why I came.,1
8649,Ses05F_script01_3_F010,"Chris, I've been ready for a long time.",-1
8650,Ses05F_script01_3_F011,I almost got married two years ago.,-1
8651,Ses05F_script01_3_F012,You started to write me.,-1
8652,Ses05F_script01_3_F013,Every day since.,-1
8653,Ses05F_script01_3_F014,Well I was waiting for you!  I mean I didn't-until then you hadn't written and when you write- when you wrote what did you say?  I mean you sure can be ambiguous Chris.,-1
8654,Ses05F_script01_3_F015,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,1
8655,Ses05F_script01_3_F016,"Not like that, you're not.",1
8656,Ses05F_script01_3_F017,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?",1
8657,Ses05F_script01_3_F018,"No, what is it, your mother?",-1
8658,Ses05F_script01_3_F019,"What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.",-1
8659,Ses05F_script01_3_F020,It wouldn't work like this.,2
8660,Ses05F_script01_3_F021,yeah sure.,3
8661,Ses05F_script01_3_F022,how many?,2
8662,Ses05F_script01_3_F023,Oh gee.,2
8663,Ses05F_script01_3_F024,Do you still feel like that?,3
8664,Ses05F_script01_3_F025,"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",2
8665,Ses05F_script01_3_F026,What would I do with a fortune?,1
8666,Ses05F_script01_3_M000,I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?,1
8667,Ses05F_script01_3_M001,So you're not sorry you came?,-1
8668,Ses05F_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
8669,Ses05F_script01_3_M003,Well--,-1
8670,Ses05F_script01_3_M004,What?,3
8671,Ses05F_script01_3_M005,Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,1
8672,Ses05F_script01_3_M006,How did you know?,3
8673,Ses05F_script01_3_M007,"Well, would you want to?  I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.",-1
8674,Ses05F_script01_3_M008,"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!",1
8675,Ses05F_script01_3_M009,"I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.",1
8676,Ses05F_script01_3_M010,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",1
8677,Ses05F_script01_3_M011,"Then, he's gone forever-you're sure?",-1
8678,Ses05F_script01_3_M012,Why didn't you?,-1
8679,Ses05F_script01_3_M013,You felt something that far back?,-1
8680,Ses05F_script01_3_M014,"Annie, why didn't you say something to me?",-1
8681,Ses05F_script01_3_M015,"Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-",-1
8682,Ses05F_script01_3_M016,Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.,1
8683,Ses05F_script01_3_M017,"Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1
8684,Ses05F_script01_3_M018,I kissed you.,-1
8685,Ses05F_script01_3_M019,Let's Let's drive someplace.  I- I want to be alone with you.,-1
8686,Ses05F_script01_3_M020,"No, nothing like that.",-1
8687,Ses05F_script01_3_M021,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",2
8688,Ses05F_script01_3_M022,I don't know how to start.,-1
8689,Ses05F_script01_3_M023,"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",2
8690,Ses05F_script01_3_M024,Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.,2
8691,Ses05F_script01_3_M025,Yeah.  I lost them.,2
8692,Ses05F_script01_3_M026,just about all.,2
8693,Ses05F_script01_3_M027,Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,2
8694,Ses05F_script01_3_M028,"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",2
8695,Ses05F_script01_3_M029,"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",2
8696,Ses05F_script01_3_M030,I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,2
8697,Ses05F_script01_3_M031,"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",2
8698,Ses05F_script01_3_M032,"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",2
8699,Ses05F_script01_3_M033,And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,2
8700,Ses05F_script01_3_M034,And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,2
8701,Ses05F_script01_3_M035,"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",2
8702,Ses05F_script01_3_M036,And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,2
8703,Ses05F_script01_3_M037,"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",2
8704,Ses05F_script01_3_M038,"And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.",-1
8705,Ses05F_script01_3_M039,"I I want you now, Annie.",1
8706,Ses05F_script01_3_M040,"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",1
8707,Ses05F_script02_1_F000,Fine.,3
8708,Ses05F_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,3
8709,Ses05F_script02_1_F002,It's not your flashlight.,-1
8710,Ses05F_script02_1_F003,It's ours- our flashlight.  It's yours and mine.,-1
8711,Ses05F_script02_1_F004,"I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?",-1
8712,Ses05F_script02_1_F005,yes.,3
8713,Ses05F_script02_1_F006,I am cold.,-1
8714,Ses05F_script02_1_F007,"It's after eleven, let's go home.",3
8715,Ses05F_script02_1_F008,There is no point in coming out here.,-1
8716,Ses05F_script02_1_F009,That's my point.,-1
8717,Ses05F_script02_1_F010,So let's go.,-1
8718,Ses05F_script02_1_F011,Not particularly.,3
8719,Ses05F_script02_1_F012,I just don't.,3
8720,Ses05F_script02_1_F013,"Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.",-1
8721,Ses05F_script02_1_F014,"What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.",-1
8722,Ses05F_script02_1_F015,I am just not.,3
8723,Ses05F_script02_1_F016,Yes.,3
8724,Ses05F_script02_1_F017,"Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",-1
8725,Ses05F_script02_1_F018,We didn't see them the first time either.,-1
8726,Ses05F_script02_1_F019,That's the wind.,-1
8727,Ses05F_script02_1_M000,"What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--",1
8728,Ses05F_script02_1_M001,actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?,1
8729,Ses05F_script02_1_M002,"Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?",1
8730,Ses05F_script02_1_M003,"Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.",1
8731,Ses05F_script02_1_M004,"The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?",-1
8732,Ses05F_script02_1_M005,Whose is it?,-1
8733,Ses05F_script02_1_M006,"Well, Sure.",-1
8734,Ses05F_script02_1_M007,"No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?",-1
8735,Ses05F_script02_1_M008,"Well, I hope the moon stays out.  Well, I wonder do they always wander during a full moon?  I can't remember, wasn't it full last year?  Do you remember?",-1
8736,Ses05F_script02_1_M009,"Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?",1
8737,Ses05F_script02_1_M010,"I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.",1
8738,Ses05F_script02_1_M011,[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,1
8739,Ses05F_script02_1_M012,you want my jacket?,1
8740,Ses05F_script02_1_M013,"Are you kidding?  We'd miss it. We just got here, what's the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave.",-1
8741,Ses05F_script02_1_M014,Right.,1
8742,Ses05F_script02_1_M015,That's my point too.,-1
8743,Ses05F_script02_1_M016,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?",-1
8744,Ses05F_script02_1_M017,Why not?,-1
8745,Ses05F_script02_1_M018,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",1
8746,Ses05F_script02_1_M019,"Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.",1
8747,Ses05F_script02_1_M020,"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.",1
8748,Ses05F_script02_1_M021,This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah,1
8749,Ses05F_script02_1_M022,Yeah they do.,-1
8750,Ses05F_script02_1_M023,"Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.",1
8751,Ses05F_script02_1_M024,There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.,1
8752,Ses05F_script02_1_M025,For real?,-1
8753,Ses05F_script02_1_M026,"I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.",-1
8754,Ses05F_script02_1_M027,We weren't in a good spot.,-1
8755,Ses05F_script02_1_M028,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I got a great instinct for these things.,-1
8756,Ses05F_script02_1_M029,"Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?",1
8757,Ses05F_script02_1_M030,"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.",1
8758,Ses05F_script02_1_M031,"Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.",1
8759,Ses05F_script02_1_M032,It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.,1
8760,Ses05F_script02_1_M033,"They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.",1
8761,Ses05F_script02_1_M034,"Well, So what do you think?",1
8762,Ses05F_script02_2_F000,About what?,-1
8763,Ses05F_script02_2_F001,It's ridiculous.,-1
8764,Ses05F_script02_2_F002,"It's PR, somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach.",-1
8765,Ses05F_script02_2_F003,"Yeah, they are all told the same thing.  They are all told that you know.  Gets them excited and they can't wait and that if they just get in on the right spot, than you than maybe life will start",-1
8766,Ses05F_script02_2_F004,I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.,-1
8767,Ses05F_script02_2_F005,"God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.",0
8768,Ses05F_script02_2_F006,I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.,-1
8769,Ses05F_script02_2_F007,"For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.",-1
8770,Ses05F_script02_2_F008,We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.,-1
8771,Ses05F_script02_2_F009,"Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.",-1
8772,Ses05F_script02_2_F010,"No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.",-1
8773,Ses05F_script02_2_F011,"I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.",-1
8774,Ses05F_script02_2_F012,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",-1
8775,Ses05F_script02_2_F013,"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",2
8776,Ses05F_script02_2_F014,"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",2
8777,Ses05F_script02_2_F015,"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",1
8778,Ses05F_script02_2_F016,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",2
8779,Ses05F_script02_2_F017,I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.,2
8780,Ses05F_script02_2_F018,No.,2
8781,Ses05F_script02_2_F019,No.,2
8782,Ses05F_script02_2_F020,No.,-1

8785,Ses05F_script02_2_F023,No no.,-1
8786,Ses05F_script02_2_F024,I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.,-1
8787,Ses05F_script02_2_F025,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,2
8788,Ses05F_script02_2_F026,"Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",2
8789,Ses05F_script02_2_F027,But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.,2
8790,Ses05F_script02_2_F028,"I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.",2
8791,Ses05F_script02_2_F029,I didn't say that.,2
8792,Ses05F_script02_2_F030,"For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",2
8793,Ses05F_script02_2_F031,"For heaven's sake, don't you know that?",-1
8794,Ses05F_script02_2_F032,"Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",2
8795,Ses05F_script02_2_F033,Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,1
8796,Ses05F_script02_2_F034,"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.",1
8797,Ses05F_script02_2_F035,"Augie, you bought refreshments.",-1
8798,Ses05F_script02_2_F036,Well than we don't need glasses.,-1
8799,Ses05F_script02_2_F037,"No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.",1
8800,Ses05F_script02_2_F038,Or not.,-1
8801,Ses05F_script02_2_M000,"Well, so?  What do you think?",1
8802,Ses05F_script02_2_M001,What I was just saying.,-1
8803,Ses05F_script02_2_M002,It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,3
8804,Ses05F_script02_2_M003,"I am not the only one, look at all these people.",3
8805,Ses05F_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
8806,Ses05F_script02_2_M005,"Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",3
8807,Ses05F_script02_2_M006,What's bugging you?,-1
8808,Ses05F_script02_2_M007,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.",-1
8809,Ses05F_script02_2_M008,Why not?,-1
8810,Ses05F_script02_2_M009,"We miss them twice, it's not ever.",-1
8811,Ses05F_script02_2_M010,Well We will see them this year.,3
8812,Ses05F_script02_2_M011,I thought you wanted to see it.,-1
8813,Ses05F_script02_2_M012,"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.",-1
8814,Ses05F_script02_2_M013,"Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.",-1
8815,Ses05F_script02_2_M014,"When you are on the phone with Marge, everything was fine.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and I said, great, let's go I am feeling lucky.",-1
8816,Ses05F_script02_2_M015,"Right, so I am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage.",-1
8817,Ses05F_script02_2_M016,"Wait a minute, I got it.",3
8818,Ses05F_script02_2_M017,"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's get some champagne.  And I said time wasting or something like that.  Right? of course.",-1
8819,Ses05F_script02_2_M018,"Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?",1
8820,Ses05F_script02_2_M019,You want me to go get some champagne?,1
8821,Ses05F_script02_2_M020,Take off our shoes?,1
8822,Ses05F_script02_2_M021,"What, you want me to whisper in your ear?",-1
8823,Ses05F_script02_2_M022,You want to get married again?,-1
8824,Ses05F_script02_2_M023,What? What You want a divorce?,-1
8825,Ses05F_script02_2_M024,"A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?",-1
8826,Ses05F_script02_2_M025,What.  Welcome to the human race.,0
8827,Ses05F_script02_2_M026,"You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.",-1
8828,Ses05F_script02_2_M027,"No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.",-1
8829,Ses05F_script02_2_M028,Because you know what Carla?  You know what you get?  This.,-1
8830,Ses05F_script02_2_M029,Yes it is.,-1
8831,Ses05F_script02_2_M030,Right.,-1
8832,Ses05F_script02_2_M031,"No, I know me either.",2
8833,Ses05F_script02_2_M032,Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,2
8834,Ses05F_script02_2_M033,"No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.",2
8835,Ses05F_script02_2_M034,Yeah?,-1
8836,Ses05F_script02_2_M035,"Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",1
8837,Ses05F_script02_2_M036,I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,1
8838,Ses05F_script02_2_M037,"Well, look what we have got here.",1
8839,Ses05F_script02_2_M038,"Well, it's not champagne.",-1
8840,Ses05F_script02_2_M039,Are you still cold?  You still want to go home?,-1
8841,Ses05F_script02_2_M040,"Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",1
8842,Ses05F_script02_2_M041,Or not.,1
8843,Ses05F_script03_1_F000,You think it's them?,-1

8845,Ses05F_script03_1_F002,What will be do?,-1
8846,Ses05F_script03_1_F003,Now and always my sweet.,-1
8847,Ses05F_script03_1_F004,It was bound to happen sooner or later.,-1
8848,Ses05F_script03_1_F005,"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",1
8849,Ses05F_script03_1_F006,Behave exquisitely.,1
8850,Ses05F_script03_1_F007,"Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.",1
8851,Ses05F_script03_1_F008,Um... It's a pity that one can't stay this way forever.,-1
8852,Ses05F_script03_1_F009,"Well, it's true.",-1
8853,Ses05F_script03_1_F010,The whole business is really rather ridiculous.,3
8854,Ses05F_script03_1_F011,Meaning exactly that.,3
8855,Ses05F_script03_1_F012,Don't laugh at me; I'm serious.,-1
8856,Ses05F_script03_1_F013,Who's they?,3

8863,Ses05F_script03_1_F020,"Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?",-1
8864,Ses05F_script03_1_F021,"My dear, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",-1
8865,Ses05F_script03_1_F022,"Elliot, worms don't pop.",-1
8866,Ses05F_script03_1_F023,"Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",-1
8867,Ses05F_script03_1_F024,Which particular one?,-1
8868,Ses05F_script03_1_F025,Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,1
8869,Ses05F_script03_1_F026,I know.  You threw him out the window into the canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,-1
8870,Ses05F_script03_1_F027,It went on intermittently for days.,-1
8871,Ses05F_script03_1_F028,"Uh- It burned all the towels in the bathroom, too.",-1
8872,Ses05F_script03_1_F029,That was the first time you ever hit me.,-1
8873,Ses05F_script03_1_F030,And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,1
8874,Ses05F_script03_1_F031,"Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous",1
8875,Ses05F_script03_1_F032,And very much sillier.,-1
8876,Ses05F_script03_1_F033,You knew there was nothing.,3
8877,Ses05F_script03_1_M000,Good God.,1
8878,Ses05F_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,1
8879,Ses05F_script03_1_M002,It must be them then.,-1
8880,Ses05F_script03_1_M003,"We're all right, darling, aren't we whatever happens?",-1
8881,Ses05F_script03_1_M004,I don't care then.,-1
8882,Ses05F_script03_1_M005,Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,1
8883,Ses05F_script03_1_M006,"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?",-1
8884,Ses05F_script03_1_M007,With the most perfect poise.,1
8885,Ses05F_script03_1_M008,"[LAUGHTER] Oh, the things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?",-1
8886,Ses05F_script03_1_M009,"Darling, don't say that.",-1
8887,Ses05F_script03_1_M010,"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",-1
8888,Ses05F_script03_1_M011,"What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",1
8889,Ses05F_script03_1_M012,"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.",-1
8890,Ses05F_script03_1_M013,"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.",1
8891,Ses05F_script03_1_M014,Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].,1
8892,Ses05F_script03_1_M015,Who knows?,1
8893,Ses05F_script03_1_M016,"No, that fire will fade along with our passion.",1
8894,Ses05F_script03_1_M017,It all depends on how well we played.,1
8895,Ses05F_script03_1_M018,"Yes, yes, with all his might.",1
8896,Ses05F_script03_1_M019,"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",1
8897,Ses05F_script03_1_M020,"no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --",1
8898,Ses05F_script03_1_M021,enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.,1
8899,Ses05F_script03_1_M022,"Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",1
8900,Ses05F_script03_1_M023,"I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.",-1
8901,Ses05F_script03_1_M024,Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,1
8902,Ses05F_script03_1_M025,The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,1
8903,Ses05F_script03_1_M026,"Horrible thing, I hate it.",1
8904,Ses05F_script03_1_M027,How long did that row last?,1
8905,Ses05F_script03_1_M028,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,1
8906,Ses05F_script03_1_M029,"Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?",1
8907,Ses05F_script03_1_M030,"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",3
8908,Ses05F_script03_1_M031,[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.,1

8910,Ses05F_script03_1_M033,"Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",1
8911,Ses05F_script03_2_F000,You knew there was nothing in that.,3
8912,Ses05F_script03_2_F001,Only a trivial little broach.,3
8913,Ses05F_script03_2_F002,"No, not at all.  I-I still have it.  I wear it quite often.",-1
8914,Ses05F_script03_2_F003,You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,3
8915,Ses05F_script03_2_F004,"maybe just a little, but--",3
8916,Ses05F_script03_2_F005,And what of it?,3
8917,Ses05F_script03_2_F006,"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.",3

8919,Ses05F_script03_2_F008,I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.,-1
8920,Ses05F_script03_2_F009,No.,-1

8922,Ses05F_script03_2_F011,"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.",3
8923,Ses05F_script03_2_F012,It's becoming a habit with you.,3
8924,Ses05F_script03_2_F013,Don't be so stupid.,-1
8925,Ses05F_script03_2_F014,Just making myself fascinating for you.,3
8926,Ses05F_script03_2_F015,It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?,-1

8954,Ses05F_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,-1
8955,Ses05F_script03_2_M002,"I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.",-1
8956,Ses05F_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,-1

8962,Ses05F_script03_2_M009,"So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?",3
8963,Ses05F_script03_2_M010,I'll have a little I think.,3
8964,Ses05F_script03_2_M011,"No particular reason, besides, they were very small ones.",-1
8965,Ses05F_script03_2_M012,You can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on.,-1
8966,Ses05F_script03_2_M013,You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,0

8972,Ses05F_script03_2_M019,It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,0

8974,Ses05F_script03_2_M021,"Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",-1

8977,Ses05F_script03_2_M024,Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,0
8978,Ses05F_script03_2_M025,I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,0
8979,Ses05F_script03_2_M026,"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.",0
8980,Ses05F_script03_2_M027,I'm not the least bit drunk.,-1
8981,Ses05F_script03_2_M028,I think I mentioned once before that I had only three-minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long.  A child of two could not be drunk on that.,-1
8982,Ses05F_script03_2_M029,"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of three or a child of six?  How about a child of nine?",-1
8983,Ses05F_script03_2_M030,"Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.",-1

8996,Ses05F_script03_2_M043,"Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",0
8997,Ses05M_impro01_F000,Can I help you?,3
8998,Ses05M_impro01_F001,"Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..",3
8999,Ses05M_impro01_F002,"Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.",3
9000,Ses05M_impro01_F003,"Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-",3
9001,Ses05M_impro01_F004,"No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --",3
9002,Ses05M_impro01_F005,"Sir, don't get an attitude with me.",-1
9003,Ses05M_impro01_F006,"No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.",3
9004,Ses05M_impro01_F007,I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.,-1
9005,Ses05M_impro01_F008,"You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.",-1
9006,Ses05M_impro01_F009,I know.,3

9009,Ses05M_impro01_F012,Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.,3
9010,Ses05M_impro01_F013,"I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.",-1
9011,Ses05M_impro01_F014,"Sir, please don't waste my time.",-1
9012,Ses05M_impro01_F015,There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.,-1
9013,Ses05M_impro01_F016,"They're different forms, we process them all different-",-1
9014,Ses05M_impro01_F017,I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.,-1
9015,Ses05M_impro01_F018,"Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.",-1
9016,Ses05M_impro01_F019,They're processed differently.,-1
9017,Ses05M_impro01_F020,"Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.",-1
9018,Ses05M_impro01_F021,I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.,0
9019,Ses05M_impro01_F022,But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.,-1
9020,Ses05M_impro01_F023,"Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.",0
9021,Ses05M_impro01_M000,"Yes, I'm um- just getting my I.D.  I need a new I.D.",-1
9022,Ses05M_impro01_M001,What do you mean?  I filled out my forms and I rushed to get my I.D.,-1
9023,Ses05M_impro01_M002,The wrong form?,-1
9024,Ses05M_impro01_M003,What's wrong about this form?  It says new I.D. on it.,-1
9025,Ses05M_impro01_M004,What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?,-1
9026,Ses05M_impro01_M005,"I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.",0
9027,Ses05M_impro01_M006,yeah.,-1
9028,Ses05M_impro01_M007,right.,-1
9029,Ses05M_impro01_M008,"Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?",-1
9030,Ses05M_impro01_M009,"Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?",-1
9031,Ses05M_impro01_M010,This is ridiculous.  I've been here for forty five minutes. Just standing in this one line. I took fifteen minutes to fill out that form.,-1
9032,Ses05M_impro01_M011,Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?,-1
9033,Ses05M_impro01_M012,Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.,-1
9034,Ses05M_impro01_M013,Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?,-1
9035,Ses05M_impro01_M014,"Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?",-1
9036,Ses05M_impro01_M015,"Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.",0
9037,Ses05M_impro01_M016,Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.,-1
9038,Ses05M_impro01_M017,That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.,-1
9039,Ses05M_impro01_M018,I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.,-1
9040,Ses05M_impro01_M019,"Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.",-1
9041,Ses05M_impro01_M020,That's just dumb.,-1
9042,Ses05M_impro01_M021,I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!,-1
9043,Ses05M_impro01_M022,"This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.",-1

9420,Ses05M_impro07_M047,Great.  Okay.,1
9421,Ses05M_impro08_F000,"Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",-1
9422,Ses05M_impro08_F001,Yeah.  That my service just goes out.,-1
9423,Ses05M_impro08_F002,yeah.,-1
9424,Ses05M_impro08_F003,"And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-",-1
9425,Ses05M_impro08_F004,"Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.",-1
9426,Ses05M_impro08_F005,"Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.",3
9427,Ses05M_impro08_F006,"Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.",3
9428,Ses05M_impro08_F007,Hmm. Mmm.,3
9429,Ses05M_impro08_F008,yeah.,3
9430,Ses05M_impro08_F009,"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",3
9431,Ses05M_impro08_F010,Oh really?,-1
9432,Ses05M_impro08_F011,"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",3
9433,Ses05M_impro08_F012,Uh huh.,3
9434,Ses05M_impro08_F013,All right.,3
9435,Ses05M_impro08_F014,"Yeah, I see that.",3

9437,Ses05M_impro08_F016,Okay.,3
9438,Ses05M_impro08_F017,"Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.",3
9439,Ses05M_impro08_F018,"Uh huh, Okay.",3
9440,Ses05M_impro08_F019,"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",3
9441,Ses05M_impro08_F020,"what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?",-1
9442,Ses05M_impro08_F021,Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really?,-1
9443,Ses05M_impro08_F022,"Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.",1
9444,Ses05M_impro08_F023,It's so frustrating.,-1
9445,Ses05M_impro08_F024,Thank you so much.,-1
9446,Ses05M_impro08_F025,"Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.",1
9447,Ses05M_impro08_F026,"Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.",1

9449,Ses05M_impro08_F028,Okay.  Thanks.,1

9452,Ses05M_impro08_M002,You've lost your connection.,3
9453,Ses05M_impro08_M003,okay.,3
9454,Ses05M_impro08_M004,Hmm.  Mmm.,3
9455,Ses05M_impro08_M005,Has somebody tried to pin your site?,3
9456,Ses05M_impro08_M006,"Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?",3
9457,Ses05M_impro08_M007,"Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?",3
9458,Ses05M_impro08_M008,"Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --",3
9459,Ses05M_impro08_M009,"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.",3
9460,Ses05M_impro08_M010,"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",3
9461,Ses05M_impro08_M011,"Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?",3

9463,Ses05M_impro08_M013,Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?,3

9465,Ses05M_impro08_M015,And hit enter.,3
9466,Ses05M_impro08_M016,Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?,3
9467,Ses05M_impro08_M017,"Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.",3
9468,Ses05M_impro08_M018,Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?,3
9469,Ses05M_impro08_M019,"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",3
9470,Ses05M_impro08_M020,"Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",3
9471,Ses05M_impro08_M021,"Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.",3

9477,Ses05M_impro08_M027,All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.,3
9478,Ses05M_impro08_M028,"All right.  Bye, bye.",1
9479,Ses05M_script01_1_F000,What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,2
9480,Ses05M_script01_1_F001,When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?,2
9481,Ses05M_script01_1_F002,When?,-1
9482,Ses05M_script01_1_F003,What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,-1
9483,Ses05M_script01_1_F004,Did you talk to him?,2
9484,Ses05M_script01_1_F005,He cried hard?,2
9485,Ses05M_script01_1_F006,"What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.",-1
9486,Ses05M_script01_1_F007,What's the meaning of that?,-1
9487,Ses05M_script01_1_F008,What?,-1
9488,Ses05M_script01_1_F009,What do you mean dishonest?,-1
9489,Ses05M_script01_1_F010,"What do you want to do, argue with him?",-1
9490,Ses05M_script01_1_F011,You can't say that to him.,-1
9491,Ses05M_script01_1_F012,how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?,-1
9492,Ses05M_script01_1_F013,"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?",-1
9493,Ses05M_script01_1_F014,"The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",0
9494,Ses05M_script01_1_F015,Why?,-1
9495,Ses05M_script01_1_F016,"Well, I have an idea.  But what's the story?",-1
9496,Ses05M_script01_1_F017,"Well, that's your business, Chris.",-1
9497,Ses05M_script01_1_F018,"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",0
9498,Ses05M_script01_1_F019,"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't --",-1
9499,Ses05M_script01_1_F020,I'm just saying.,-1
9500,Ses05M_script01_1_F021,"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",0
9501,Ses05M_script01_1_F022,"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?",0
9502,Ses05M_script01_1_F023,"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",3
9503,Ses05M_script01_1_F024,Have you asked Annie yet?,3
9504,Ses05M_script01_1_F025,"Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?",3
9505,Ses05M_script01_1_F026,"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",3
9506,Ses05M_script01_1_F027,"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",-1
9507,Ses05M_script01_1_F028,"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.",-1
9508,Ses05M_script01_1_F029,"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.",-1
9509,Ses05M_script01_1_F030,Just give it some more thought.,-1
9510,Ses05M_script01_1_F031,What the hell is this?,-1
9511,Ses05M_script01_1_F032,Are you crazy?,0
9512,Ses05M_script01_1_F033,"What?  You mean?  Tell me something, you mean that you would leave the business?",-1
9513,Ses05M_script01_1_F034,You can't think like that.,-1
9514,Ses05M_script01_1_F035,"All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",0
9515,Ses05M_script01_1_F036,Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?,0
9516,Ses05M_script01_1_F037,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
9517,Ses05M_script01_1_F038,"Yeah, I can see that.",-1
9518,Ses05M_script01_1_M000,He saw it.,-1
9519,Ses05M_script01_1_M001,He was out here when it broke.,-1
9520,Ses05M_script01_1_M002,"I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke.",-1
9521,Ses05M_script01_1_M003,"I don't know, but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen.",-1
9522,Ses05M_script01_1_M004,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,2
9523,Ses05M_script01_1_M005,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,-1
9524,Ses05M_script01_1_M006,I guess he is.,-1
9525,Ses05M_script01_1_M007,"I don't know the meaning of it, but you know one thing Mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",-1
9526,Ses05M_script01_1_M008,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,-1
9527,Ses05M_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,-1
9528,Ses05M_script01_1_M010,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,-1
9529,Ses05M_script01_1_M011,"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",0
9530,Ses05M_script01_1_M012,We have to say it to him.,-1
9531,Ses05M_script01_1_M013,For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!,0
9532,Ses05M_script01_1_M014,"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",-1
9533,Ses05M_script01_1_M015,"All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?",-1
9534,Ses05M_script01_1_M016,You know.,3
9535,Ses05M_script01_1_M017,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,3
9536,Ses05M_script01_1_M018,It's not just my business.,-1
9537,Ses05M_script01_1_M019,So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?,-1
9538,Ses05M_script01_1_M020,"Oh, so it isn't just my business?",0
9539,Ses05M_script01_1_M021,You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.,0
9540,Ses05M_script01_1_M022,"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",0
9541,Ses05M_script01_1_M023,She is not Larry's girl!,0
9542,Ses05M_script01_1_M024,"I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.",-1
9543,Ses05M_script01_1_M025,To hell with that!,0
9544,Ses05M_script01_1_M026,I wanted to get this taken care of first.,-1
9545,Ses05M_script01_1_M027,"Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",-1
9546,Ses05M_script01_1_M028,So what?  I'm not fast with women.,0
9547,Ses05M_script01_1_M029,Because it is.,-1
9548,Ses05M_script01_1_M030,"I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",-1
9549,Ses05M_script01_1_M031,"All right then, mom.",-1
9550,Ses05M_script01_1_M032,"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",0
9551,Ses05M_script01_1_M033,"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",0
9552,Ses05M_script01_1_M034,"I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.",0
9553,Ses05M_script01_1_M035,I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.,0
9554,Ses05M_script01_1_M036,"Yes.  On this, I would.",0
9555,Ses05M_script01_1_M037,"Well, you help me stay here.",0
9556,Ses05M_script01_1_M038,"I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.",-1
9557,Ses05M_script01_1_M039,I am thinking that way.,-1
9558,Ses05M_script01_1_M040,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",-1
9559,Ses05M_script01_1b_F000,What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,2
9560,Ses05M_script01_1b_F001,"What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",-1
9561,Ses05M_script01_1b_F002,When?,-1
9562,Ses05M_script01_1b_F003,What was he doing out here four in the morning?,-1
9563,Ses05M_script01_1b_F004,Did you talk to him?,-1
9564,Ses05M_script01_1b_F005,He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?,-1
9565,Ses05M_script01_1b_F006,What?,-1
9566,Ses05M_script01_1b_F007,What do you mean dishonest?,-1
9567,Ses05M_script01_1b_F008,"What are you gonna do, argue with him?",-1
9568,Ses05M_script01_1b_F009,"Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?",-1
9569,Ses05M_script01_1b_F010,"To you it is and to me, but not to him.",-1
9570,Ses05M_script01_1b_F011,You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?,-1
9571,Ses05M_script01_1b_F012,"The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--",-1
9572,Ses05M_script01_1b_F013,Why?,-1
9573,Ses05M_script01_1b_F014,"Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?",-1
9574,Ses05M_script01_1b_F015,"Well, that's your business, Chris.",-1
9575,Ses05M_script01_1b_F016,"What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.",-1
9576,Ses05M_script01_1b_F017,"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't gonna --",-1
9577,Ses05M_script01_1b_F018,"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",-1
9578,Ses05M_script01_1b_F019,"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead.  And she's still his girl.",-1
9579,Ses05M_script01_1b_F020,"Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.",-1
9580,Ses05M_script01_1b_F021,"Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.",-1
9581,Ses05M_script01_1b_F022,Have you asked Annie yet?,3
9582,Ses05M_script01_1b_F023,"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.",3
9583,Ses05M_script01_1b_F024,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,3
9584,Ses05M_script01_1b_F025,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,-1
9585,Ses05M_script01_1b_F026,"Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.",3
9586,Ses05M_script01_1b_F027,"No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.",-1
9587,Ses05M_script01_1b_F028,"Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",2
9588,Ses05M_script01_1b_F029,Just give it some more thought.,-1
9589,Ses05M_script01_1b_F030,What the hell is this?,-1
9590,Ses05M_script01_1b_F031,Are you crazy?,0
9591,Ses05M_script01_1b_F032,But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?,-1
9592,Ses05M_script01_1b_F033,Must you be inspired?,0
9593,Ses05M_script01_1b_F034,You don't want to think like that.,0
9594,Ses05M_script01_1b_F035,"All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.",-1
9595,Ses05M_script01_1b_F036,"Don't think like that, do you hear me?",-1
9596,Ses05M_script01_1b_F037,"I don't understand you, do I?",-1
9597,Ses05M_script01_1b_F038,"Yeah, I can see that.",-1
9598,Ses05M_script01_1b_M000,He saw it.,-1
9599,Ses05M_script01_1b_M001,He was out here when it broke.,2
9600,Ses05M_script01_1b_M002,About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,2
9601,Ses05M_script01_1b_M003,"I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",2
9602,Ses05M_script01_1b_M004,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,2
9603,Ses05M_script01_1b_M005,"Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",2
9604,Ses05M_script01_1b_M006,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,-1
9605,Ses05M_script01_1b_M007,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,-1
9606,Ses05M_script01_1b_M008,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean,-1
9607,Ses05M_script01_1b_M009,"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?",-1
9608,Ses05M_script01_1b_M010,"For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!",-1
9609,Ses05M_script01_1b_M011,"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",-1
9610,Ses05M_script01_1b_M012,"All right.  All right, just listen.",-1
9611,Ses05M_script01_1b_M013,"You know why I invited Annie, right?",-1
9612,Ses05M_script01_1b_M014,You know.,-1
9613,Ses05M_script01_1b_M015,I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,-1
9614,Ses05M_script01_1b_M016,You know it's not just my business.,-1
9615,Ses05M_script01_1b_M017,So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?,-1

9620,Ses05M_script01_1b_M022,what to hell with that!,0
9621,Ses05M_script01_1b_M023,I wanted to get this settled first.,-1
9622,Ses05M_script01_1b_M024,"Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it seems like she's forgotten him.",-1

9624,Ses05M_script01_1b_M026,"So what, I'm not fast with women?",-1
9625,Ses05M_script01_1b_M027,Because it is.,-1
9626,Ses05M_script01_1b_M028,"[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,",-1
9627,Ses05M_script01_1b_M029,"she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",-1
9628,Ses05M_script01_1b_M030,"All right then, mom.",-1

9633,Ses05M_script01_1b_M035,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,0
9634,Ses05M_script01_1b_M036,"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.",0
9635,Ses05M_script01_1b_M037,"I'd like to build something that's my own.  And Annie is in the center of that.  Now, where do I find it?",-1
9636,Ses05M_script01_1b_M038,"Well, you help me stay here.",-1
9637,Ses05M_script01_1b_M039,"I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.",-1
9638,Ses05M_script01_1b_M040,"Well, I am thinking like that.",0
9639,Ses05M_script01_1b_M041,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",0
9640,Ses05M_script01_2_F000,Why did you invite her here?,-1
9641,Ses05M_script01_2_F001,"She's been in New York three and a half years, why all of a sudden?",-1
9642,Ses05M_script01_2_F002,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,3
9643,Ses05M_script01_2_F003,He's not going to marry her.,-1
9644,Ses05M_script01_2_F004,He's got that about it.,3
9645,Ses05M_script01_2_F005,"What's going on here, Joe?",0
9646,Ses05M_script01_2_F006,"No.  She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",-1
9647,Ses05M_script01_2_F007,"Then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.",-1
9648,Ses05M_script01_2_F008,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",-1
9649,Ses05M_script01_2_F009,"Nobody in this house dares takes her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",-1
9650,Ses05M_script01_2_F010,"I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense.",-1
9651,Ses05M_script01_2_F011,"No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!",-1
9652,Ses05M_script01_2_F012,But why did that happen the very night she came back?  She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it.,-1
9653,Ses05M_script01_2_F013,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",-1
9654,Ses05M_script01_2_F014,Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.,-1
9655,Ses05M_script01_2_F015,You above all have got to believe.,0
9656,Ses05M_script01_2_F016,Just don't stop believing.,-1
9657,Ses05M_script01_2_F017,I can't help it.,0
9658,Ses05M_script01_2_M000,Why does that bother you?,3
9659,Ses05M_script01_2_M001,"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",3
9660,Ses05M_script01_2_M002,"What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.",-1
9661,Ses05M_script01_2_M003,Why do you think he's even thinking that?,3
9662,Ses05M_script01_2_M004,"Well, so what?",-1
9663,Ses05M_script01_2_M005,Now listen.,-1
9664,Ses05M_script01_2_M006,You don't know.  You can't read her mind.,-1
9665,Ses05M_script01_2_M007,How do you know why she's waited?,-1
9666,Ses05M_script01_2_M008,"Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?",-1
9667,Ses05M_script01_2_M009,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?",-1
9668,Ses05M_script01_2_M010,But Kate?,-1
9669,Ses05M_script01_2_M011,Calm yourself.,-1
9670,Ses05M_script01_2_M012,Calm yourself.,-1
9671,Ses05M_script01_2_M013,All right.  All right.,-1
9672,Ses05M_script01_2_M014,"What do you mean, me above all?",-1
9673,Ses05M_script01_2_M015,"What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.",0
9674,Ses05M_script01_2_M016,"What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?",0
9675,Ses05M_script01_3_F000,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,3
9676,Ses05M_script01_3_F001,It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.,1
9677,Ses05M_script01_3_F002,No.  But I'm not going to stay.,-1
9678,Ses05M_script01_3_F003,"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",3
9679,Ses05M_script01_3_F004,You saw that.  And well you've been --,-1
9680,Ses05M_script01_3_F005,You've been sort of embarrassed since I got here.,-1
9681,Ses05M_script01_3_F006,"I figured they would, your mother at least.",3
9682,Ses05M_script01_3_F007,"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",3
9683,Ses05M_script01_3_F008,"Yes, that's why I came.",-1
9684,Ses05M_script01_3_F009,"Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.",1
9685,Ses05M_script01_3_F010,I almost got married two years ago.,2
9686,Ses05M_script01_3_F011,You started to write me.,-1
9687,Ses05M_script01_3_F012,Everyday since.,1
9688,Ses05M_script01_3_F013,"Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.",1
9689,Ses05M_script01_3_F014,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've sat around wondering if I was crazy for thinking of you.,-1
9690,Ses05M_script01_3_F015,Not like that you're not.,1
9691,Ses05M_script01_3_F016,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?",2
9692,Ses05M_script01_3_F017,"No.  Chris, what is it?  Is it your mother?",-1
9693,Ses05M_script01_3_F018,You have to tell me.,-1
9694,Ses05M_script01_3_F019,Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,2
9695,Ses05M_script01_3_F020,You have to tell me.,2
9696,Ses05M_script01_3_F021,It wouldn't work like this.,2
9697,Ses05M_script01_3_F022,"Yeah, sure.",3
9698,Ses05M_script01_3_F023,How many?,2
9699,Ses05M_script01_3_F024,Do you still feel like that?,2
9700,Ses05M_script01_3_F025,"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",2
9701,Ses05M_script01_3_F026,"And you father, he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",-1
9702,Ses05M_script01_3_F027,[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?,1
9703,Ses05M_script01_3_M000,"I know.  It's going out of style, isn't it?",-1
9704,Ses05M_script01_3_M001,"So, you're not sorry I came?",1
9705,Ses05M_script01_3_M002,Why?,-1
9706,Ses05M_script01_3_M003,Well-,3
9707,Ses05M_script01_3_M004,What?,-1
9708,Ses05M_script01_3_M005,"Well, I planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so, but they all take it for granted that we're set.",-1
9709,Ses05M_script01_3_M006,How did you know?,-1
9710,Ses05M_script01_3_M007,"Well, so would you want to?  I mean, I guess you know that's why I asked you to come.",-1
9711,Ses05M_script01_3_M008,"Annie, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. -I",-1
9712,Ses05M_script01_3_M009,"I don't know what to say.  I have no imagination.  That's all I have to say to you.  God, I'm embarrassing you. I-I didn't want to do this here. I- I wanted to do it someplace different, someplace where we could be new to each other.",-1
9713,Ses05M_script01_3_M010,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.",1
9714,Ses05M_script01_3_M011,So he's gone forever then?  You sure?,-1
9715,Ses05M_script01_3_M012,Why didn't you?,-1
9716,Ses05M_script01_3_M013,You felt something that far back?,1
9717,Ses05M_script01_3_M014,"Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?",-1
9718,Ses05M_script01_3_M015,"Give me a kiss, Annie.  Give me a --",-1
9719,Ses05M_script01_3_M016,"oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?",1
9720,Ses05M_script01_3_M017,"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",1
9721,Ses05M_script01_3_M018,I kissed you.,-1
9722,Ses05M_script01_3_M019,Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.,2
9723,Ses05M_script01_3_M020,"No, nothing like that.",2
9724,Ses05M_script01_3_M021,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.",2
9725,Ses05M_script01_3_M022,I don't I don't know where to start.,3
9726,Ses05M_script01_3_M023,It's so mixed up with so many other things.,2
9727,Ses05M_script01_3_M024,"You remember when I was overseas, I was in command of a company?",-1
9728,Ses05M_script01_3_M025,I lost them.,2
9729,Ses05M_script01_3_M026,Just about all.,2
9730,Ses05M_script01_3_M027,"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",2
9731,Ses05M_script01_3_M028,"For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.",-1
9732,Ses05M_script01_3_M029,I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.,2
9733,Ses05M_script01_3_M030,"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",2
9734,Ses05M_script01_3_M031,"Everything was being destroyed see, but I felt like something new was being created at the same time.  Like it kind of -- responsibility.  You know, man to man.  Do you understand what I'm saying?",-1
9735,Ses05M_script01_3_M032,"And and to see that again, to to bring that back on the earth again, like- like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them.",-1
9736,Ses05M_script01_3_M033,It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,2
9737,Ses05M_script01_3_M034,"I mean, the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them.",-1
9738,Ses05M_script01_3_M035,So I went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again.,-1
9739,Ses05M_script01_3_M036,"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",2
9740,Ses05M_script01_3_M037,"It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,",-1
9741,Ses05M_script01_3_M038,"you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.",-1
9742,Ses05M_script01_3_M039,And I guess that included you.,2
9743,Ses05M_script01_3_M040,"I want you now, Annie.",2
9744,Ses05M_script01_3_M041,"Oh, Annie,",1
9745,Ses05M_script01_3_M042,Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,1
9746,Ses05M_script02_1_F000,Fine.,2
9747,Ses05M_script02_1_F001,What flashlight?,3
9748,Ses05M_script02_1_F002,You mean our flashlight?,-1
9749,Ses05M_script02_1_F003,"I mean, you kept saying my flashlight, the flashlight like it was only somehow yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?",-1
9750,Ses05M_script02_1_F004,Yes.,-1
9751,Ses05M_script02_1_F005,I'm cold.,-1
9752,Ses05M_script02_1_F006,It's after eleven.  Let's just go home.,-1
9753,Ses05M_script02_1_F007,There is no point in coming out here.,-1
9754,Ses05M_script02_1_F008,That's my point.,-1
9755,Ses05M_script02_1_F009,So let's go.,-1
9756,Ses05M_script02_1_F010,Not particularly.,-1
9757,Ses05M_script02_1_F011,I just don't.,-1
9758,Ses05M_script02_1_F012,it's stupid.,-1
9759,Ses05M_script02_1_F013,Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,-1
9760,Ses05M_script02_1_F014,"What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.",-1
9761,Ses05M_script02_1_F015,Augie.,-1
9762,Ses05M_script02_1_F016,I'm just not.,2
9763,Ses05M_script02_1_F017,Yes.,-1
9764,Ses05M_script02_1_F018,"Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.",-1
9765,Ses05M_script02_1_F019,We didn't see them the first time either.,-1
9766,Ses05M_script02_1_F020,That's the wind.,-1
9767,Ses05M_script02_1_M000,"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?",1
9768,Ses05M_script02_1_M001,"What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",1
9769,Ses05M_script02_1_M002,"This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.",1
9770,Ses05M_script02_1_M003,"The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.",1
9771,Ses05M_script02_1_M004,Well-,-1
9772,Ses05M_script02_1_M005,"Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.",1
9773,Ses05M_script02_1_M006,"How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?",1
9774,Ses05M_script02_1_M007,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.",1
9775,Ses05M_script02_1_M008,"I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]",1
9776,Ses05M_script02_1_M009,"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something",1
9777,Ses05M_script02_1_M010,Do you want my jacket?,1
9778,Ses05M_script02_1_M011,"Are you kidding?  We just got here, we'd miss it.  What's the point of coming all the way out here if we're just going to turn around and go home?",-1
9779,Ses05M_script02_1_M012,Right.,-1
9780,Ses05M_script02_1_M013,"That's my point, too.",-1
9781,Ses05M_script02_1_M014,"Oh, no, no, no.  no That's not my point.  My point is what's the point coming out here if we're just going to leave?  Don't you want to see it?",-1
9782,Ses05M_script02_1_M015,Why not?,-1
9783,Ses05M_script02_1_M016,Oh,-1
9784,Ses05M_script02_1_M017,"Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.",1
9785,Ses05M_script02_1_M018,"I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.",1
9786,Ses05M_script02_1_M019,"Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,",1
9787,Ses05M_script02_1_M020,"and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.",1
9788,Ses05M_script02_1_M021,"I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.",1
9789,Ses05M_script02_1_M022,"Yeah, they do.",-1
9790,Ses05M_script02_1_M023,"All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.",1
9791,Ses05M_script02_1_M024,For real?,-1
9792,Ses05M_script02_1_M025,"I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.",-1
9793,Ses05M_script02_1_M026,We weren't in a good spot.,-1
9794,Ses05M_script02_1_M027,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got a great sense for these things.,-1
9795,Ses05M_script02_1_M028,"Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.",1
9796,Ses05M_script02_1_M029,"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;",1
9797,Ses05M_script02_1_M030,somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,1
9798,Ses05M_script02_1_M031,"And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,",1
9799,Ses05M_script02_1_M032,"they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.",1
9800,Ses05M_script02_1_M033,"Well, so what do you think?",1
9801,Ses05M_script02_2_F000,About what?,3
9802,Ses05M_script02_2_F001,It's ridiculous.,3
9803,Ses05M_script02_2_F002,It's P.R. somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach.,-1
9804,Ses05M_script02_2_F003,"Sure.  Everybody is told the same thing, it keeps us all excited.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",-1
9805,Ses05M_script02_2_F004,"I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.",-1
9806,Ses05M_script02_2_F005,"God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.",0
9807,Ses05M_script02_2_F006,I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,-1
9808,Ses05M_script02_2_F007,"For God's sake, Augie.  It's- Grow up, we're not going to see the grunion.",-1
9809,Ses05M_script02_2_F008,We We don't ever.  Have we ever?,-1
9810,Ses05M_script02_2_F009,"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",0
9811,Ses05M_script02_2_F010,"No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.",0
9812,Ses05M_script02_2_F011,You don't understand anything I am saying.,-1
9813,Ses05M_script02_2_F012,I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,2
9814,Ses05M_script02_2_F013,Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,2
9815,Ses05M_script02_2_F014,"And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",2
9816,Ses05M_script02_2_F015,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",2
9817,Ses05M_script02_2_F016,I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.,2
9818,Ses05M_script02_2_F017,No.,2
9819,Ses05M_script02_2_F018,No.,2
9820,Ses05M_script02_2_F019,No.,2
9821,Ses05M_script02_2_F020,[LAUGHTER] No.,-1
9822,Ses05M_script02_2_F021,No.,-1
9823,Ses05M_script02_2_F022,No.,2
9824,Ses05M_script02_2_F023,I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,2
9825,Ses05M_script02_2_F024,This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,-1
9826,Ses05M_script02_2_F025,"Sure, this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",-1
9827,Ses05M_script02_2_F026,But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,2
9828,Ses05M_script02_2_F027,"This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?",2
9829,Ses05M_script02_2_F028,"I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",2
9830,Ses05M_script02_2_F029,But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,2
9831,Ses05M_script02_2_F030,I didn't say that.,2
9832,Ses05M_script02_2_F031,"For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",2
9833,Ses05M_script02_2_F032,"Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",2
9834,Ses05M_script02_2_F033,"Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",-1
9835,Ses05M_script02_2_F034,"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.",1
9836,Ses05M_script02_2_F035,"Augie, you brought refreshments.",-1
9837,Ses05M_script02_2_F036,"Well, then we don't need glasses.",-1
9838,Ses05M_script02_2_F037,"No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.",1
9839,Ses05M_script02_2_F038,Or not.,1
9840,Ses05M_script02_2_M000,"Well, so, what do you think?",1
9841,Ses05M_script02_2_M001,What I was just saying.,1
9842,Ses05M_script02_2_M002,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,-1
9843,Ses05M_script02_2_M003,"I'm not the only one, look at all these people.",-1
9844,Ses05M_script02_2_M004,Are we talking about the same thing?,-1
9845,Ses05M_script02_2_M005,"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",3
9846,Ses05M_script02_2_M006,What's bugging you then?,-1
9847,Ses05M_script02_2_M007,"It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.",-1
9848,Ses05M_script02_2_M008,Why not?,-1
9849,Ses05M_script02_2_M009,We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.,-1
9850,Ses05M_script02_2_M010,"Well, we'll see them this year.",-1
9851,Ses05M_script02_2_M011,"Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.",-1
9852,Ses05M_script02_2_M012,"No, of course not.",-1
9853,Ses05M_script02_2_M013,"I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --",-1
9854,Ses05M_script02_2_M014,"you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.",-1
9855,Ses05M_script02_2_M015,Wait a minute.  I've got it.,-1
9856,Ses05M_script02_2_M016,"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",3
9857,Ses05M_script02_2_M017,"Okay.  All right No problem.  I totally understand. okey  um, listen.  Do you want to dance?",-1
9858,Ses05M_script02_2_M018,Do you want me to go get some champagne?,-1
9859,Ses05M_script02_2_M019,Take off our shoes?,-1
9860,Ses05M_script02_2_M020,"What, you want me to blow in your ear?",-1
9861,Ses05M_script02_2_M021,"Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?",-1
9862,Ses05M_script02_2_M022,A vacation?,-1
9863,Ses05M_script02_2_M023,"A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?",-1
9864,Ses05M_script02_2_M024,"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",0
9865,Ses05M_script02_2_M025,"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",0
9866,Ses05M_script02_2_M026,"Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",0
9867,Ses05M_script02_2_M027,"Yes, it is.",-1
9868,Ses05M_script02_2_M028,Right.,-1
9869,Ses05M_script02_2_M029,"Now, I know.  Me either",2
9870,Ses05M_script02_2_M030,I'm trying the best I can.,2
9871,Ses05M_script02_2_M031,"Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",2
9872,Ses05M_script02_2_M032,"No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.",2
9873,Ses05M_script02_2_M033,Really?,-1
9874,Ses05M_script02_2_M034,"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",1
9875,Ses05M_script02_2_M035,"I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",1
9876,Ses05M_script02_2_M036,"Oh, well look what we've got here.",1
9877,Ses05M_script02_2_M037,"Well, it isn't champagne.",1
9878,Ses05M_script02_2_M038,Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?,-1
9879,Ses05M_script02_2_M039,"Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.",-1
9880,Ses05M_script02_2_M040,Or not.,1
9881,Ses05M_script03_1_F000,Do you think it's them?,-1
9882,Ses05M_script03_1_F001,"what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",1
9883,Ses05M_script03_1_F002,What do we do?,1
9884,Ses05M_script03_1_F003,"Now and always, my sweet.",1
9885,Ses05M_script03_1_F004,It was bound to happen sooner or later.,1
9886,Ses05M_script03_1_F005,"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.",1
9887,Ses05M_script03_1_F006,Behave exquisitely.,-1
9888,Ses05M_script03_1_F007,I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.,-1
9889,Ses05M_script03_1_F008,What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,-1
9890,Ses05M_script03_1_F009,"Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.",-1
9891,Ses05M_script03_1_F010,Meaning just that.,-1
9892,Ses05M_script03_1_F011,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,3
9893,Ses05M_script03_1_F012,Who's they?,3
9894,Ses05M_script03_1_F013,"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",3
9895,Ses05M_script03_1_F014,"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",-1
9896,Ses05M_script03_1_F015,"Well, will we always bicker and fight?",3
9897,Ses05M_script03_1_F016,"Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?",-1
9898,Ses05M_script03_1_F017,"What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?",3
9899,Ses05M_script03_1_F018,"That's rather serious, isn't it?",-1
9900,Ses05M_script03_1_F019,"Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense.",-1
9901,Ses05M_script03_1_F020,"Elliott, worms don't pop.",3
9902,Ses05M_script03_1_F021,"Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.",-1
9903,Ses05M_script03_1_F022,Which particular one?,-1
9904,Ses05M_script03_1_F023,"Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.",-1
9905,Ses05M_script03_1_F024,I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,1
9906,Ses05M_script03_1_F025,It went on intermittently for days.,-1
9907,Ses05M_script03_1_F026,"Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.",1
9908,Ses05M_script03_1_F027,That was the first time you hit me.,-1
9909,Ses05M_script03_1_F028,"And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER]",-1
9910,Ses05M_script03_1_F029,"How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous",-1
9911,Ses05M_script03_1_F030,Very much sillier.,-1
9912,Ses05M_script03_1_F031,You knew there was nothing in that.,3
9913,Ses05M_script03_1_M000,Oh Good God.,-1
9914,Ses05M_script03_1_M001,I wonder.,1
9915,Ses05M_script03_1_M002,Must be them then?,-1
9916,Ses05M_script03_1_M003,"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",3
9917,Ses05M_script03_1_M004,I don't care then.,1
9918,Ses05M_script03_1_M005,Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.,-1
9919,Ses05M_script03_1_M006,"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.",1
9920,Ses05M_script03_1_M007,With the worst- with the most perfect poise?,1
9921,Ses05M_script03_1_M008,"Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--",1
9922,Ses05M_script03_1_M009,"things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",1
9923,Ses05M_script03_1_M010,"Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.",1
9924,Ses05M_script03_1_M011,"Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.",1
9925,Ses05M_script03_1_M012,"Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",1
9926,Ses05M_script03_1_M013,"You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.",1
9927,Ses05M_script03_1_M014,"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.",1
9928,Ses05M_script03_1_M015,uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.,1
9929,Ses05M_script03_1_M016,Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.,1
9930,Ses05M_script03_1_M017,[garbage] who knows?,-1
9931,Ses05M_script03_1_M018,No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,1
9932,Ses05M_script03_1_M019,"Well, it depends on how well we played.",-1
9933,Ses05M_script03_1_M020,"Yes, yes, with all his might.",1
9934,Ses05M_script03_1_M021,"No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.",1
9935,Ses05M_script03_1_M022,"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.",1
9936,Ses05M_script03_1_M023,"[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.",1
9937,Ses05M_script03_1_M024,"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.",1
9938,Ses05M_script03_1_M025,Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,1
9939,Ses05M_script03_1_M026,The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.,1
9940,Ses05M_script03_1_M027,Horrible thing.  I hated it.,1
9941,Ses05M_script03_1_M028,How long did that roue last?,1
9942,Ses05M_script03_1_M029,"Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?",1
9943,Ses05M_script03_1_M030,"[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?",1
9944,Ses05M_script03_1_M031,"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",1
9945,Ses05M_script03_1_M032,I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],1
9946,Ses05M_script03_1_M033,We were very much younger then.,1
9947,Ses05M_script03_1_M034,"Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden.",-1
9948,Ses05M_script03_2_F000,Oh You knew there was nothing in that.,-1
9949,Ses05M_script03_2_F001,Only a trivial little broach.,3
9950,Ses05M_script03_2_F002,Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.,3
9951,Ses05M_script03_2_F003,"[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",-1
9952,Ses05M_script03_2_F004,"Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.",3
9953,Ses05M_script03_2_F005,"Well, what of it.",3
9954,Ses05M_script03_2_F006,Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,3
9955,Ses05M_script03_2_F007,"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.",-1
9956,Ses05M_script03_2_F008,I'm getting very bored with this conversation.,-1
9957,Ses05M_script03_2_F009,No thanks.,3
9958,Ses05M_script03_2_F010,I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,-1
9959,Ses05M_script03_2_F011,"Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.",-1
9960,Ses05M_script03_2_F012,It's becoming a habit with you.,3
9961,Ses05M_script03_2_F013,Don't be stupid.,-1
9962,Ses05M_script03_2_F014,What?,-1
9963,Ses05M_script03_2_F015,Just making myself fascinating for you.,3
9964,Ses05M_script03_2_F016,"It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?",-1
9965,Ses05M_script03_2_F017,"No, it isn't.",0
9966,Ses05M_script03_2_F018,"No, it it is not, be quiet.",0
9967,Ses05M_script03_2_F019,"hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",-1
9968,Ses05M_script03_2_F020,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",-1
9969,Ses05M_script03_2_F021,They sting.,-1
9970,Ses05M_script03_2_F022,"Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?",-1
9971,Ses05M_script03_2_F023,"Yes, I did quite a lot.",3
9972,Ses05M_script03_2_F024,[LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.,-1
9973,Ses05M_script03_2_F025,You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.,-1
9974,Ses05M_script03_2_F026,You always had a weak head.,3
9975,Ses05M_script03_2_F027,"Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.",-1
9976,Ses05M_script03_2_F028,Not- Would you shut up.,0
9977,Ses05M_script03_2_F029,"You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy.",-1
9978,Ses05M_script03_2_F030,Why?,-1
9979,Ses05M_script03_2_F031,There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.,-1
9980,Ses05M_script03_2_F032,They're away in Tunis.,-1
9981,Ses05M_script03_2_F033,"Turn it on again, please.",-1
9982,Ses05M_script03_2_F034,Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.,0
9983,Ses05M_script03_2_F035,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,0
9984,Ses05M_script03_2_F036,Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.,0
9985,Ses05M_script03_2_F037,"You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.",0
9986,Ses05M_script03_2_F038,"Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.",0
9987,Ses05M_script03_2_F039,This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.,0
9988,Ses05M_script03_2_F040,"Yes, I am. Let go with me",0
9989,Ses05M_script03_2_F041,"You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!",0
9990,Ses05M_script03_2_F042,Beast,0
9991,Ses05M_script03_2_F043,Brute,0
9992,Ses05M_script03_2_F044,pig,0
9993,Ses05M_script03_2_M000,Come to think of it the real cause of that roue was Peter Burden.,-1
9994,Ses05M_script03_2_M001,I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.,-1
9995,Ses05M_script03_2_M002,"I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.",-1
9996,Ses05M_script03_2_M003,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,-1
9997,Ses05M_script03_2_M004,You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?,-1
9998,Ses05M_script03_2_M005,He let him kiss you.  You said you did.,-1
9999,Ses05M_script03_2_M006,what of it?,-1
10000,Ses05M_script03_2_M007,What about me?,-1
10001,Ses05M_script03_2_M008,"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",0
10002,Ses05M_script03_2_M009,"Me, too, bored stiff.",0
10003,Ses05M_script03_2_M010,Do you want some brandy?,3
10004,Ses05M_script03_2_M011,I think I'll have a little.,3
10005,Ses05M_script03_2_M012,"No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.",-1
10006,Ses05M_script03_2_M013,You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.,-1
10007,Ses05M_script03_2_M014,You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.,-1
10008,Ses05M_script03_2_M015,"Amanda, really.",0
10009,Ses05M_script03_2_M016,"Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?",-1
10010,Ses05M_script03_2_M017,"Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.",-1
10011,Ses05M_script03_2_M018,"Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",-1
10012,Ses05M_script03_2_M019,"Yes, it is.",-1
10013,Ses05M_script03_2_M020,It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,0
10014,Ses05M_script03_2_M021,"oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder.",-1
10015,Ses05M_script03_2_M022,"Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!",-1
10016,Ses05M_script03_2_M023,They snap.,0
10017,Ses05M_script03_2_M024,"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",3
10018,Ses05M_script03_2_M025,"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",0
10019,Ses05M_script03_2_M026,"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.",0
10020,Ses05M_script03_2_M027,I am not the slightest bit drunk.,0
10021,Ses05M_script03_2_M028,I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,0
10022,Ses05M_script03_2_M029,"Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?",0
10023,Ses05M_script03_2_M030,"You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.",0
10024,Ses05M_script03_2_M031,You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.,0
10025,Ses05M_script03_2_M032,"You better turn that off, I think.",0
10026,Ses05M_script03_2_M033,Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.,0
10027,Ses05M_script03_2_M034,"Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.",0
10028,Ses05M_script03_2_M035,This is no time of the year for Tunis.,0
10029,Ses05M_script03_2_M036,I do I shall do no such thing.,0
10030,Ses05M_script03_2_M037,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,0
10031,Ses05M_script03_2_M038,Turn it off!,0
10032,Ses05M_script03_2_M039,Very amusing indeed.,0
10033,Ses05M_script03_2_M040,Ja! Very funny.,0
10034,Ses05M_script03_2_M041,"You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.",0
10035,Ses05M_script03_2_M042,"Oh, you're not going like this.",0
10036,Ses05M_script03_2_M043,"[GARBAGE] No, you're not.",0
10037,Ses05M_script03_2_M044,oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.,0
10038,Ses05M_script03_2_M045,You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.,0
